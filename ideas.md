First pass:
Add protests and riots on the planet he returns to
When her mother extracts his memories and hacks the screens to play them, she hides him from the protests
The memories of previous harvester kids get's passed on to the next after they die

Second pass:
Re-call the grittiness of the original vision. He was basically called out of deadly, hypnotizing comfort into a deadly adventure, requiring EVERYTHING of him. But the beauty shines through regardless.
Do character profiling: what are each characters motivations?
Integrate my ideas into the outline for the second pass
Talk about the silence of the forest, that could be eery
Add wildfire
Maybe progressively change descriptions as the mind stuff wears off, but maybe let their memories coming back lead the way, might be good to do this after new chapters
Consider her mom being more involved throughout, like arranging things in places for her

Later:
Try to use as few modern words as possible
Strive to decrease reading level
Maybe all details are telling details
Include pictures, _drawings_, images
Number chapters/parts like 1,2,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5
Re-write to follow what's happening even closer, instead of "hands clawing at the ground", go "and clawed his hands at the ground"
Dumb the speach down just a bit to be more readable
Do a couple passes with Grammarly at the end
Add some humorous scenes throughout
Maybe drawings will help me not have to describe stuff too much,
Maybe allowing each chapter to have it's own poetic prose would feel more free and be more interesting.
Consider how I can make the tech, super cool, but subtle, like the green words on the wall. Or the harvesters controlled by the mind.
Make him think about Eta and beauty more on the ship
