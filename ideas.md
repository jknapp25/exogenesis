Dumb the speach down just a bit to be more readable
Do a couple passes with Grammarly at the end
Add some humorous scenes throughout
Maybe drawings will help me not have to describe stuff too much,
Maybe allowing each chapter to have it's own poetic prose would feel more free and be more interesting.
