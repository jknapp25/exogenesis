Add wildfire
Add protests and riots on the planet he returns to
When her mother extracts his memories and hacks the screens to play them, she hides him from the protests
Strive to decrease reading level
Talk about the silence of the forest, that could be eery
The memories of previous harvester kids get's passed on to the next after they die
Maybe all details are telling details
Include pictures, drawings, images
Number chapters/parts like 1,2,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5
Re-write to follow what's happening even closer, instead of "hands clawing at the ground", go "and clawed his hands at the ground"
Maybe progressively change descriptions as the mind stuff wears off, but maybe let their memories coming back lead the way, might be good to do this after new chapters
