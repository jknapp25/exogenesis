Collector comes
Memory wiped
Harvester cleaned of most dirt and blood
Moved to new location
Business as usual
No dog in site
Something feels different now to the reader
Notices a bit of blood on lever
Epic storm
Crashes and can't move
Lightning strikes his harvester and it glitches again, showing her harvester crushed below his tracks

6
Opens his airlock
Pulls her in
Ride out the storm in his machine
Go's back to his module
His stack of pillars rolled onto his home pod, crushing it
He is able to pry open the airlock and put his hand on the sparking scanner...
Cracked wall is flashing. "LEAVE", "LEAVE", "LEAVE NOW", "FIND THE CREATURE", "FIND THE CREATURE"
His module is destroyed, but they are able to scavenge some food
Water module is destroyed
Takes her to a stream for water. Remembers sitting in the stream before.
She's waking but barely conscious
Holding her in the stream, he touches her face and cries loudly. She regains consciousness.
She touches his face. "You're like me."
"Yes, I believe so. But you're very different."
Meets the girl, she’s the most incredible thing he’s ever seen, even more beautiful than the world

7
Them interacting like Adam and Eve
Quietly sitting in front of each other slowly touching each others faces
Walking
Skinny dipping

8
Remembers his dog.
Decide to search for his dog
Finds it
Finds a disaster bunker below the house with food, bed

9
Discussion about truth together
Many questions answered here

10
They both see the collector for the first time
They realize they don't have enough food for the two of them
They devise a plan for him to board a collector
Realize if he doesn't catch it, they will probably starve
Races to get on one when it’s hatches open

11
Survival on the collector
Tiny window, he watches earth shrink (waste away) -> re-inforces what the story is about
Two week trip
Survives by drinking the water collecting in the bottom of the ship, lying on the trees for warmth, doesn’t eat
Memories start coming back, starts hallucinating scenes from his past, meets his family in hallucinations

12
The operator of their planet secretly finds him when he gets off
Takes him to her place
Tells him the situation and what she has been trying to do, “you are the key"
Hacks his memory to share with mankind what he has seen
Restores his memories in the process

13
He’s wrestling with the truth
Father died young
Mother died later
remembers the girl, the dog, the place, wants to go back
see’s the girls picture while leaving, “I know her"

14
Tells the mother she’s still alive
they devise a scheme to get back together

15
They make the trek back, NOT EASILY
Ends with them stepping off the collector

16
Concludes with them in 5-10 years with the puppy living this beautiful life
