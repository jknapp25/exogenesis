# Part 1

His home pod illuminated.

Indirect light slowly climbing the walls, a cheap replica of a morning sunrise gently inviting one into a new day. But he didn't know the difference, he had never seen a sunrise. He had never seen a sunset. Or even this sun.

He scrunched his face like used paper, forcing aside another dream too frightening for words, not that there was anyone around to speak to. After this many years doing the same thing every single day, it wasn't too difficult any more to get out of bed. The only thing that occasionally made it difficult was these dreams. They kept him in their clutches, holding on to him like a mother holds on to her newborn.

If he failed to emerge, after 30 seconds the sounds would start. At first a dull roar, growing louder until it became unbearable. Vibrating the walls. It only took once for him to experience that. A sickness or something had slowed him.

Today, he's out in time.

The small barrack was only meant to house one person. It contained a clothing module. A washing module. A cooking module. And a lounging module. Everything valuable is modular. It can be replaced.

His uniform for the day protruded from the clothing module. The same uniform as any other day, though not the same garment. The module held 10 garments and kept them clean and organized. No consideration needed. He was not put here to wash clothes.

The washing module, a faucet that could be mounted high or low, advised him to splash cold water on his face in the morning. It "increases alertness by 27%", the words printed on the counters edge urged him. He didn’t know what that meant, but he did it.

He had three options for breakfast. A granular porridge, nutrient dense, but hardly flavorful. A rectangular gelatinous substance with meat suspended in something resembling egg. Completely artificial of course, it all is. And finally, a distant cousin of wheat bread with a pinkish spread. None of these did he know anything about other than how they tasted.

The second one will do.

The pod was shaped like a T, the leg stubbier than the letter looks, was the only way in or out.

He finished his meal, put his clothes on and grabbed a day ration of pre-made liquids and foods. And moved toward the leg. He placed his hand on the wall, a scanner floating across it, a pointless security protocol for him, a useful health metric for someone somewhere. The glass wall before him slid upward revealing a few steps floating upward into a sort of cockpit.

The pod and the vessel shared the same feel. It would be reasonable to assume the they were carefully designed not to expose the user to any outside air, or views.

He climbed up into the cockpit, illuminated only by a light outlining the floor, setting his ration bag off to the side and flipping a couple switches warming up some sort of clever power source.

Pulling a lever down to his left, he noticed for the first time that he had never seen the raised text on the hard surface near the lever. "In the event of an emergency, this lever can be twisted to open the hatch when not docked to an airlock."

The hatch closed. His other hand floating across a display mounted behind the steering handles. He knew the commands so well he no longer had to look at the screen. After inputting the sequence, the glass around him changed opacity, revealing an outside environment far different than the inside of the pod.

The terrain was quite rigid and angular, though the immediate areas where the home pod was located were level. It was sparse, to his right and behind him the landscape continued off into nothingness but morphing ground. In front of his machine, maybe a quarter mile, one could see countless large orange-ish pillars emerging from the ground at varying heights. The tallest maybe 60 feet.

Pulling back on the steering module, the cockpit lifted higher into the air, he liked looking down through the glass floor to see the ground press away and the massive tracks below him appear. Out of habit, he tested a button on the right handle and the enormous pincers on the front closed, pressing again they re-opened. On the left handle he toggled a couple buttons and a 12 foot chain saw blade quickly spun up and rotated horizontally below the pincers. A green check appeared on the display with the word "operational".

It had been a few months since his home module had been transported closer to the pillars and by this time his tracks had created a very smooth roadway for him to follow. Pressing forward on the steering wheel, sent the vessel in it's direction.

He began to enter the area with the pillars. Though the machine he operated was very large, the pillars still towered overhead. Looming above at different angles, with gray clouds filling the space between them.

He didn't venture far into their midst, but oriented his machine facing one of the pillars. For a moment he paused, his head still forward, his eyes quickly glanced down and to his left, for a millisecond it felt as if something flickered within view. He shifted his head back and forth playing with the reflections off the inside of the glass. Clearly it reflected his light gray ration bag as his head bobbed with the jerking movement of the machine. That explains it.

He breathed in slightly deeper than normal and returned his focus to the pillar. From this close, it's surface had a strange texture, almost fluid.

Pressing forward on the steering wheel, again the machine jerked forward.
Right-button, the giant forceps gripped the base of the pillar.
Holding left index, saw roar.
Left middle finger, the saw entered view from below and slowly pivoted from left to right.

The pillar was now completely held by the gripper, holding a button under his left index finger, the gripper arm tilted toward him, gaining speed as the angle increased, until a deep thud rocked and rattled the vessel.

He pressed forward on the steering wheel moving his vessel forward over the remaining base of the pillar.

The hours passed while he repeated this, losing his consciousness in the repetition. A sound woke him from the hypnotism. On the screen, "Take a short break."

He compressed a pedal near his left foot, the roar of the massive machine winding down in response.

Again he took a short breath, facing the clearing his eyes slowly followed the terrain out toward the horizon. So much space, completely empty. It made no difference to him what that meant, or if it meant anything. It's what he does. He knows no different.

A muffled growl came from inside his suit, reminding him of his hunger. Without looking he reached his right arm back to where he had set his ration pack, but felt nothing. Patting around, still the pack wasn't there. Twisting around, he didn't see the pack on the surface next to his seat, he remembered one time it fell down next to the wrap-around glass.

Shifting his weight, he leaned to his right and craned his neck to peer down. But clenched every muscle at the sight. The glitch appeared again. For a whole second his eyes stared directly into the ghostly creatures. The air fled from his lungs in terror. Nothing had ever gripped his soul so tightly, the eyes of another being. Fixed on his.

What was it?

He blinked twice, wiping his mind of the surrealness of what he had seen. The adrenaline coursing through his body, once he found movement, he became single-minded.

Leave NOW.

He tapped the display, it illuminated, sifting through a menu of buttons, he pressed one releasing the load behind his machine. The glitch was nowhere in sight.

He didn’t know the machine could move so quickly, in an instant he was docked at the home pod and climbing out. Placing his hand on the scanner, he froze. The air lock closing beside him. Finally he could re-capture his breath.

Sinking to the floor he recognized the feelings, he couldn't recall something so intense. Not knowing why, tears began to fall to the floor. That image, that terrifying thing, consumed him, burned into his sight.

His introduction.

# Part 2

In a windowless pod, there's no notion of day or night. His only experience of time came from the particular hue the outside environment took on towards the end of his workday. Other than that, the outside afforded him no secrets.

His head now buried in the steel sink, time was the last thing on his mind.

He splashed his face repeatedly, never thinking to ask himself questions like, “what is water?” or “where does water come from?”, the usual questions a 14yr old boy should be asking the world. Still, those superfluous concepts weren’t the reason he was placed here. Not that the science behind atmospheric water generation, would benefit him much right now anyway. In this moment he’s only concerned with the potential for the water to wash his mind of that image. And return him to what is real.

What is real.

Bold green words slid across the surface of the wall above his head, giving the metal bowl an alien fluorescence. He looked up, “You need to sleep.” The words slid back out of view to the left, and back in from the right. Until then, the thought of returning to the site, had not entered his mind. The last few hours were spent trying to forget what he had seen, the last thing he wanted to ponder was another encounter.

What if it re-appears?

Returning to his bed, the coverings were still saturated with sweat. Yet after a few minutes, he eventually found a corner of his mind to nestle himself into. And there, he found found something. Simulations.

> He was watching a boy moving quickly, leaping up tiny islands, deep purple and jagged. He was going up an incline, slipping here and there, the slow movement of the ground making the placement of his feet unpredictable. Chasing the boy was a creature, not unlike the glitch he had seen. In the dream, he could feel what the boy felt but it wasn’t the same feeling the being gave him.
>
> His perspective changed. He was now the boy, running, but looking back over his shoulder he saw the glitch. The creature’s terrifying yellow incisors slicing through the air, muzzle covered in dried blood. It pursued him, jaws agape. This now became a run for his life.
>
> He reached the crest of the incline, it leveled out but the trail dropped off to nothingness. He had nowhere to go. Terrified, he waited a few moments for the creature to emerge, but nothing. Nothing came over. He inched forward, peering back down the trail. It leaped up! Tackling him to the ground! All he could do was shield himself with his arms, expecting his flesh to be torn away, but there was no blood. Instead it caressed him with it’s tongue. Uncovering his face, he saw the beasts eyes held no terror.

He felt the vibrations tingle his skin before noticing any sound. Stepping onto the floor, the noise ceased immediately though it faded in his ear like someone kept their foot on a sustain pedal. His dream followed suit...

What was that? He asked himself. He juggled the blurry images in his mind, unable to re-call the full sequence of events, but was able to hold onto the feeling. Somehow he knew this feeling was important. A source of strength.

Immediately, he began his morning rhythm. His body going through the steps, while his mind explored an idea. Maybe he was mistakenly afraid. Maybe the glitch was not what he thought it was. Maybe he should return. The feeling grew like it was rolling down a snowy hill gaining size and momentum, until it resembled courage and even curiosity.

Truth is compelling.

He tucked his head to clear the opening of the cockpit and lowered down into the seat. He continued his motions as usual, pausing for a second before pressing the button that would reveal the outside.

The road to the pillars was rougher today, he imagined it must have shifted when he rushed back the day before. Part-way there, a large mass now blocked his passage. For a moment, he considered it an escape, his excuse to not go back, but his new-found courage urged him to try something. Spinning the vessel and pressing with the right track, he was able to nudge the mass off the adjacent drop-off.

After a quarter of the day had passed, he realized the pile of columns he had accumulated from today’s and the previous day’s cutting might be too large for his vessel to move in one load if he didn’t take it back to the pod soon. Deciding not to deviate too far from his usual rhythm, he reloaded the pillars, dropped them outside his pod, and returned.

Something about coming back after not having seen anything earlier released the tension in his shoulders and relaxed his constant scanning of his surroundings. He got back to work.

It was only a few minutes til he saw something moving between the pillars. Immediately, he stopped what he was doing and backed the machine away from the current pillar. Frozen in his chair, he waited.

And waited.

Like someone flipped a switch, the glitch appeared. He tensed. Directly in front of the vessel, it stood on four legs, eyes fixed on his, the same yellow teeth that chased him in the dream. More horrendous this time. It flickered only once for a moment, but otherwise stayed in view like it was determined to declare it’s presence.

Neither of them moved an inch for what felt like a lifetime. He observed the matted fur of the beast containing all sorts of debris, the blood stained fur around it’s neck, the protruding lines across it’s sides.

How is it still alive?

Maintaining eye-contact, he twisted his head slightly and tilted it to the left, bringing the lever on the floor into view. Cautiously bouncing his eyes up and back he re-read the words next to it, “…this lever can be twisted to open the hatch…”

His curiosity overcame any judgement.

Slowly he moved his hand down to the lever. Upon grasping it, the creature jerked it’s head upward while opening it’s jaws. This sent him tense again, not knowing what the gesture meant. Still he held. In the moment, he remembered something he had heard, “...if you enter the outside, you will die immediately. The atmosphere cannot sustain life."

Oh well...

The cockpit glass popped upward, and then slid back. The orange world he knew wiped away like a reverse painting. Everything completely changed accept for the creature, anchored to it’s position in the universe.

The sun stabbed him in his retinas. The pain was intense for a few moments, but receded fairly quickly.

The beauty of the outside sent his senses into hysteria. A shiver rushed through his body. He had never seen color like this, he had never heard sound like this, he had never felt air or the sun like this, he had never…

A noise interrupted his temporary transcendence, pulling him back to the moment. The creature, voraciously screaming was now closer. It was confusing what it was doing, but it felt important.

Looking down at the massive tracks below, he stepped over the side and shimmied low enough to drop onto them.

In response, the creature stepped closer, continuing it’s shrieking.

Slowly the boy moved forward on the track, til he neared the edge. The creature stopped it’s sound and froze, staring intently.

He crouched, peered at the mysterious surface below, then jumped down.

A pause, nothing happened, but only for a moment...

The beast exploded at him. Leaping for his face, tackling him to the ground. Thrashing and biting at every inch of skin possible.

The boy was defenseless, unable to land any blows that made an impact, but still scratching in his writhing. The blood began to flow. Both beings fighting for their lives with everything inside of them.

Finally, he shoved the beast to the side, seizing the opportunity to grasp it’s ratted mane and throw it against a pillar. It hit hard, let out a yelp, and collapsed to the ground. He also collapsed. Staring at the lifeless being while his vision faded into darkness.

# Part 3

The door closed loudly.

Her gait was slow as she approached the front of the room, her sullen face hung low. He scanned the room quickly as she approached the front, it was filled with others like him, but very different. Their bodies held different terrain, different colors, different hair, they gave off different feelings. And they all sat looking in one direction, facing one wall of the room. He did the same.

She had a black, full-body suit on, red angles above the hands like her arm was dipped in a bucket of paint.

Lifting her head to the group, her eyes panned from right to left before beginning. “I’m very excited to be the one speaking with you today.” Though her face showed nothing of the sort. “Today is very special. You are very special. Do you know why your special?” She stepped to her left, lowering her head and folding her arms behind her back as if waiting for a response. “Hmm?” Turning her head towards the group. “You represent the triumph of the human spirit. Everything it’s taken to get to where we are today. Courage, inventiveness, curiosity. And still, you are the future. This planet and the others the human race inhabits, is scarce. To sustain life, we need to look onward to new horizons. New worlds.” Pausing to settle the air. "You, have been chosen to do that.”

Confused, he thought, Chosen? I thought I volunteered.

“We are sending all of you on an adventure. To a new planet, where you will explore. And return to us with knowledge of it’s habitability. You are the future of the human race.” The words trailed off and fell on the floor, yet still some in the room seemed eager. "It’s time to begin preparations.” She winced slightly, masking the expression by turning and starting back toward the door. “Follow me."

His consciousness returned to him, his senses following at their own pace. Hands, then feet, legs, arms, then his head and neck. A strange sensation there. It reminded him of the dream from the night before. In his minds eye, he again saw the creature standing over him with an innocent gaze.

Still not reminded of his location. He opened his eyes.

There next to him was the glitch, it’s muzzle buried in his neck. The boy noticed, then retracted his head, feeling as though the creature was too close for comfort. To his surprise, it looked down on him with the same eyes as the dream. Eye's devoid of the terror they once had. Not sure what to make of the situation, he slowly lifted his hand to his neck as not too startle the creature, and held it above himself littered with streaks of red.

Immediately, he recoiled, shuffling backward on hands and feet, keeping it safely in view. It didn’t react, in fact it didn’t move an inch but just continued staring at him.

He sat there, poised to stand and run, but he couldn’t get himself to move.

The dust settled, and the creature carefully placed one paw in the boys direction, testing the situation. With it’s tail low and straight, it lowered it’s muzzle to the ground as if smelling a trail, it’s eyes catching his gaze intermittently.

It pretended to sniff the ground around his outstretched leg, then moved to his boot, and his torn suit leg where his skin could be seen red, irritated, and caked in dried dirt and foliage. It pressed aside the synthetic fabric, a couple flies disseminating, and caressed the wound. The boy winced, as stiff as a board, but recognized somehow the feeling was helping. The being was seemingly avoiding eye contact, but after a few seconds it started rolling it’s eyes up to the boy’s. Whether it was actually healing the wound he did not know, but he felt an unmistakable connection to the creature anyway. A doorway into a heart starved of relationship. The creature was not trying to hurt him.

What now? He thought after a short time taking in his environment. He could still tell from the amount of light, that the day was not even halfway over.

He pressed down on the ground with his right hand, leaning to regain some footing, feeling the pains of the death match from before. Arising, he looked at the creature, a gaze that somehow established a temporary truce between the two.

He stepped in the direction of the clearing he had made from the previous days. But was surprised by the pain in his leg, forcing him to limp. Upon starting, the animal shared the same ailment. Something about the two of them dealing with the same pain they inflicted on each other, sent a suttle laughter into the boys chest that grew until audible. It continued to grow doubling him over with the extra pain the laughing inflicted on his abdomen. Hands resting on his knees, he looked up to the animal a few paces ahead of him. It seemed to share a jovial look, with it’s mouth open, tongue hanging out the left side of it’s jaws.

Eventually gaining composure, he decided to look around a bit. He rounded his vessel, noticing a few words below the cockpit window. “HARVESTER” in big bold letters, and below in smaller red, “SpaceX”.

Harvester. He recounted, what does that mean? Being on this side of the glass, it felt strange to never have known much of anything about the machine.

He stood in the center of the massive circular clearing. 100 yards in diameter. Still and quiet, he looked upward amazed at the rich blue above him. He felt warm inside, peaceful, until he lowered his head back down.

The pillars, the things he had spent so much time cutting, moving. Now looked overhwelmingly beautiful. Their movement so soft and liquid in the slow wind. Their color so intense, contrasting against the blue above. But what he stood amidst, felt different. He only now realized that they were here, and now they are gone, because of him. Because of what he had done, day in and day out. He was harvesting beauty.

He needed to know the full scope of what he had done. Turning back, he purposefully passed the animal and the harvester and started down the road to where it entered the pillars. Reaching the opening, there before him was nothingness, as far as he could see. The terrain protruded here and there, but it was bare, nothing but pieces of pillars, corpses scattered about, the tracks of his vessel winding their way like endless scribbles through the rubble.

Like lightning struck his heart, he dropped to his knees and started sobbing. It was clear what he had done. There was no mistaking. He remembered the vision that came to him when he had fainted, “You are the future…you have been chosen…” LIES. Nothing but LIES. I’m no explorer. I'm no pioneer. No adventurer. I’m a murderer. Sent here to destroy.

The animal called to him. A shrill sound, that startled him. The creature seemed to have a way of bringing him back.

Back to reality.

He turned and stood, his tears leaving dirt trails winding down his cheeks.

The creature, a few yards back, stared at him with intention like it had when he sat in the cockpit but this time it felt as though it was beckoning his soul. It turned away from him and started back up to the pillars.

“Wait!” The boy yelled. Receiving no response from the animal, he wiped his face on his sleeve and ran to join his companion.

When he had almost caught up, it saw him and started running as well. “What are you doing!” He shirked his limp in favor of not falling behind.

It veered in a different direction, avoiding the area where the harvester sat. Taking them directly within the pillars. Beneath their cover, the light changed, confusing the boys simplistic idea of time. Deeper and deeper they ran, leeping over fallen pillars, shuffling up inclines, slipping on loose ground. The creature always staying out of his reach but looking back continually to check on him.

The boy felt as though his senses were on fire. The rough surface of the pillars against his hand, the smell of the green surrounding them, the soil compressing with his footsteps, the air licking his skin as he ran, something was awakening inside of him.

The harvester was now nowhere in sight. Nothing he had ever known was in sight. Everything around him was alien, the shifting light across the pillars green clouds confounded him, the soft green hair that covered parts of their surface, the unpredictability of everything around him. He found himself wanting to stop and just stand, but his companion continued onward.

They rounded a steeper incline tracing a contour line around it, then bent back the opposite way. The creature suddenly disappeared within a dense grouping of pillars, which he noticed, but didn’t slow his pursuit. Sliding into the grove of pillars, like an overfilled wardrobe, he went a few paces, then was stopped in his tracks.

The creature before him, have of it’s body down in some small ravine, raised it’s head to recognize his presence, it’s fur darker and thicker looking, then lowered it down again as if pre-occupied. The boy stepped forward to look at what it’s attention was on. Nearing, it looked as though a tiny crack, maybe 6 feet across had opened in the ground. Some gleeming liquid down in the bottom of it, followed the unpredictable twists and turns of it’s shape, without stopping at any point. He stood above it, absolutely enthralled by the concept. Questions arose inside him, “what is it?”, “where does it come from?”, “who turned it on?".

The animal consumed so much of the liquid, it just kept going and going. He found it so interesting that it could use the same part of it’s body to connect with him, mending his wounds and to shovel this liquid. What a peculiar being.

What could be so interesting about this liquid? He knelt down to it and watched it glimmer in the light. Tiny green ropes waded in it’s missed, tossed here and there by it’s movement. Looking again at the animal, he remembered the warning, “...you will die immediately. The atmosphere cannot sustain life.” And yet here he is, feeling more alive than ever before.

He lowered one leg into the crack next to the flowing liquid, then leaned, his hand hovering above it for a moment. A splinter of fear toward this world still remained. He lowered it below the surface, surprised that he felt almost nothing but a slight warmth. He played with the unnatural shape of his hand under the liquid as he moved it around. Recognizing the distortion. Eventually he concluded it must be similar to the liquid in his home pod.

Bringing his other leg down as well, he crouched by the flow, and lowered both of his hands below the surface, the dark brown haze of material releasing from his hand in chunks, revealing the true color of his skin.

He re-arranged his body to mimic the animal, thinking it might be best to consume the liquid the same way it does. The space between the liquid and the edge of the crack was not much though, so he had to get above and slide his head and torso down into it. He slid more and more, the liquid just out of reach, then slid down a little more. Losing balance, he flipped feet over head and rolled directly into the liquid catching gulps of it til he sat back up in it’s midst. He coughed involuntarily, the beckoning of himself reminding him of the creatures before. He looked at the creature sitting calmly on the edge of the crack and his coughing turned once again into uncontrollable laughter.

The stream of liquid, came up above his legs now, and he just let it flow about him. Fro, the laughter, the warmth of the brighness, and the warmth of the liquid it felt too good to get out. From this angle, all he could see were the creatures muzzle, the pillars above, the blue atmosphere, and the winding crack before him.

He sat, in it for a while, his mind wandering, something about the glimmering flow put him in a sort of trance. It felt easier to think. What have I missed out on? How could this have been here all this time? What is this place? Why did I think I would die? Where does this liquid come from?

Where do I come from?

Shivers rippled through his body. That was the question, he sensed it. It felt dangerous to ask it, but he didn’t know why.

Breaking from his trance, his companion was gone.

# Part 4

He hobbled up on two feet, regaining a sense of his surroundings. The creature was nowhere in sight.

Startled by his sudden aloneness, he pressed up on the edge of the crack and planted his heavy liquid-filled boot on it’s edge like the man on the moon.

Below him the shape of the creature was still wet on the ground, and he could see it’s steps trailing off into the thick pillars once again. He had no other clue as to it’s whereabouts so he started in the direction of it’s steps, paying careful attention not to lose them.

Never had he been alone in such a place. It felt ominous, overpowering. He felt as though he was at the mercy of his surroundings, as if there was a power he did not understand behind them. Placing a hand on each pillars surface as he wound his way through them, he started to feel a connection to this place. He pressed aside the pillars green clouds as they were before him, noticing the distinct scent they held, different than the scent of the ground.

He weaved his way through the pillars like a ghost. One eye checked the ground but usually sunk into the details of the pillars or the different shapes of the pieces making up the green clouds.

The pillars finally gave way to an openness, a spectacular green painted the surface of the ground, it was different than the green of the pillars. It stood low and was made of different textures. But the way the light was now licking it, created an incredible feeling. Like magic, if he had known what that was. The light felt fluid, thick and golden, like he could cup it in his hand or it would stick if he touched a pillars surface.

Lowering a knee, he floated his hand through the fibers. They reminded him of his hair in the morning.

He felt its eyes.

Across the small opening the creature stood away from him, silent but watching. Its body turned away. He wondered if it watched over this place. If it understand the shapes and colors. If it understood him. Somehow the creature knew he would find it. Turning away, it slipped into a dark hole in a massive overgrown maze of greenness. The tangle amidst browns and other greens felt chaotic but purposeful.

Floating his eyes over the chaos, he noticed above it all a red column protruding. It looked nothing like surroundings. He was surprised he hadn’t seen it before. It appeared to be made of red rectangles kept together by white lines. Atop it, a shiny cone focused the light toward him.

It felt like a key of some sort. To what, he couldn’t tell.

At this moment, it felt beyond him to betray the creatures trust, so he approached the opening slowly. Feeling the warm air move over his skin as he waded through rivers of full sunlight. Nothing stuck it’s head out, the glitch didn’t re-appear. So he continued, now realizing just how dense the growth was. Through it’s weaving he couldn’t see more than a few feet in.

The opening was no higher than his knee so he dropped, his hand pressing into the earth on top of the glitch's imprint. He felt it’s shape. Full body now flat on the ground, any reluctance to touching surfaces had wained after he had found himself rising from unconciousness like an unburied corpse. Though that experience now felt more like a birth than a death.

He crawled forward inch by inch through the tiny unknown, his elbows and knees flaring to the sides to somehow push him forward. A sharpness stabbed his knee as he brought it through the opening, looking down, his clothing was caught on one of the loose arms of the mass. It was lined with tiny spikes, and one was caught on him.

What is this thing? He thought, wincing while he reached back, releasing it’s grasp on his thigh. The voracity with which that one arm held him brought to mind his powerlessness in this moment. If it fell down upon him, no amount of thrashing or pushing could set him free. He would be consumed.

I can’t do this. A trickling fear brought him to a stop. It started to consume his thoughts. I can’t do this. A sting near his elbow, he was caught again. It set him off. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this! He writhed back and forth as the stabs spread across his body. I can’t! Tears and blood now flowing. Help. Help! Mamama. He mumbled audibly. Mama! The word burst out of his soul, meaningless to his conscience though full of meaning. MAMA…

An arrow struck his heart, the glitches eyes, it’s muzzle low to the ground at the end of the tunnel. It appeared frozen in time, unblinking, completely focused on him. He knew those eyes. The storm within died down. His breathe slowly catching up with him.

Who are you?, he questioned silently, though he heard the words like he spoke them aloud.

The air filled his lungs, I can do this. Arm pressing down and back, he didn’t bother with the web of vines now attached to him. Now the other arm, straining, their eyes still fixed. Eventually nearing the end, his captors relinquished their hold one by one, having made his movement far more strenuous.

The glitch backed as he stood and regained himself. Still conscious of his presence in it’s demeanor. It turned back, like returning to some previous task.

He glanced up at the creature, and the structure before him grasped ahold of his attention. Now within the chaotic web of green, the glitch ascended a few stairs onto a short platform that lined the front of some sort of structure. It’s windows were cracked and broken, green robbers now reaching their arms through the openings, giving it the appearance of being consumed by the world. The glitch paid no attention, in fact, it didn’t even turn it’s head to observe like he was. Surely it was familiar with this place.

Is this your pod? He wondered. Though he didn’t waste much time basking in the absurdity of this place, recognizing maybe the glitch had brought him here for a reason. He moved toward the structure observing it thoroughly with the reduced light available to him amidst the dome of overgrowth. It didn’t quite make sense to him how are why it could be here.

The first step groaned loudly below him like some dormant beast, and the structure only grew angrier with each footfall. Over the platform floated another level, three columns holding it with the last of their strength, one additional column in the middle had given way and now the overhang bowed before him. It was not like him to question origins but this structure seem to be at such war with the surroundings that he couldnt help but wonder how and why.

The glitch had slipped through an opening torn through the center of some mesh stretched across the doorway. Through the mesh and due to the absence of light, it was not clear to him what hid within, so he lowered to his hands and knees and slipped his head through. He blinked a few times thinking his eyes had betrayed him because the darkness released no secrets, but after a few moments paused in this position his eyes started to decript shapes and edges. It wasn’t clear if his friend was anywhere to be found.

Heslowly pressed his thin shoulders through the tear, and his legs awkwardly followed.

Agh! A sharp pain shot stuck the palm of his right hand. Investigating it, a tiny glimmering sort of rock was partially embedded in the skin. He sat to reach his hand back through the opening to use it’s light, then winced as he slid it out. Why does this place hurt so bad? He asked himself, thinking for a moment that maybe this world was at war with him as well.

He looked back into the room, the space appeared to grow to his left and right. A few feet in front of where he sat, a peculiar square lie, glimmering rocks all over it. He reached toward it, carefullly being sure not to touch any more of the shiny blades and they all fell from it’s frame, creating a startlingly loud noise. Within the square was something rivaling any of the strange things he had encountered before. On a piece of material were three beings. One’s that felt so different than any he had encountered. They felt familiar, in a way, like he knew himself. They reminded him of himself.

He had seen these beings in his dreams. Something solidified in the air. They are like me.

He slipped the image in his sleeve before returning to his surroundings. The place took on a new hue. This IS a home pod. Everything he saw, though lying in such disarray, felt more important. Like someone had placed a lense over his eyes. He saw those beings like holograms, moving around the space, in and out of it’s hallways. He saw them touch, run, fight, laugh, he felt more like a ghost than they did.

He followed one of the smaller ghosts as it ran down a hall and into a room. The hall was lined with some more images still hanging, some fell to the floor, glimmering rocks littered the ground. The room cast light into the hall and somehow beckoned for his attention, he floated his eyes across the images like glancing through scattered windows and stepped through the doorway, first noticing the large portal to the outside with light pouring down over green tendrils reaching here and there slowly claiming the space for themselves.

In a small alcove to his right below a bar hooked with clothing mostly fallen on the floor and partially devoured by time, there was the glitch. It curled like a C on the ground next to two smaller copies of itself.

There’s more of you?

The little creatures hair was far less matted and covered in debris than the glitches but it was clear to him they were of the same sort but far less threatening. The eye’s of one had not opened yet. He crept closer, feeling out of place in this scenario, uncertain what the glitch might do with his presence. As he approached it did nothing, but kept it’s eyes on the small ones, watching them wiggle and nuzzle within it’s bare flesh.

Kneeling before, he could almost feel a warmth radiating from the 3, whether a temperature or something else he couldn’t say. But it felt so peaceful. It felt like a triangle of life emitting something clearly life-giving.

He touched the tiny body of one of the small versions and felt a tingle crawl through his skin. It felt so delicate below his hand.

A yellow glow of light turned the room into a block of gold and warmed it even further. He felt no desire to ever go anywhere else. In fact staring down at these beings, he wanted to nuzzle in the glitches bosom himself. Maybe there would be protection there. Maybe there would be something different.

Yellow light. Oh no. I’m late.

Never had the concept of being late been something to him. He he knew somehow that he needed to get back to his home pod. He had a schedule. He had to follow it. This thought felt threatening, he stood as he recognized that he had never considered why. What wants me back. This wasn’t the time to consider for he had no resources. A strong sturring wrenched his insides, beckoning him to find food. It’s time to go.

The glitch finally looked up at him. Their eyes said everything that could be said.

Outside the golden room, he glanced to his left at the room he had entered through and felt the fear re-emerge. Without hesitation he turned down the other direction of the hall. It opened to an even large space cut in half by a pillar lying on the floor like it fell asleep on the carpet. Tons of golden light streamed in through the gaping opening to the outside.

Maybe this’ll work. He placed his hand on the enormous fallen thing and in that moment noticed the floor strewn about by papers littered in words and images. Their surface a light brown. He didn’t have the time to read them but he felt them shout at him. He grabbed as many as he could and stuffed them down through his collar, the only place his suit would hold anything.

He scaled the side of the rough pillar, taller than himself and stood on it’s corpse. YES. Down the length of it was his obvious escape Even the green chaos lie below the pillars body and had not arisen to consume it yet. His steps were quick though wobbly because of the sloping surface.

Despite weaving in and out of his previous route, the dramatic terrain had left such an imprint in his subconscious that he found the return not much of a challenge.

Entering his pod, he finally started to catch his breath. Looking around, the space had changed, although everything seemed exactly as he had left it. It felt like an eery silence had taken up residence without asking first.

The artificial light was now almost unbearable. It felt representative of something threatening. Regardless, he devoured the only thing he knew to be food and layed his head in bed that night still kneeling next to the creatures he had met in the world he had discovered. Everything had changed. And everything was going to change.

I’ll be there tomorrow. I have to see more. The thoughts slowly dissolved into dreams.

# Part 5

At one point in history, almost every engineer in the world decided that sheet metal was the greatest invention since sheets of bread. Rapidly everything was distilled into shapes that could be manufactured using this efficient new technology. Unfortunately, some engineer neglected to consider the fact that sheet metal creates an incredible inhospitable living space.

He woke up with his right hand touching the ice cold surface next to his bed. No sound told him when, no vibration shook him, just a feeling. Purely rhythm. “Instinct" some might call it, that sounds better than lines of code.

Wasting no time, he planted his feet on the ice cold floor.

He grabbed his uniform, prepared by the clothing module. 
He splashed his face at the washing module. 
Ate the porridge.
Took the rations.
Scanned his hand.
Climbed the steps.
And sat down.

He leaned to look down beside his seat, and looked down at the lever. There was markings, a strange red substance had dried on the surface. He didn’t linger on it, but wiped it off with the edge of his sleeve and pulled.

Fingers moved across the display in a sequence like deep ruts in a road driven over countless times. The smoke wiped away from the glass, revealing it.

Huh...

He sat and observed the orange shapes around him with an ice cold expression nearing indifference. A foreign terrain.

Moved again...That was quicker than last time. It gave him no particular feeling, no question came to mind, no exploration into the reason for his new home. He purely noticed the change.

It was just another day.

He put it in forward and was on his way. The new rough terrain was enjoyable, ungroomed from months of rolling over the same paths. The enormous machine bounced him back and forth over protruding masses, slopey terrain and ruts. It wasn't quite play, but he was content as Sysiphus on dementia.

This was a much shorter ride since replacement always set him right next to a fresh patch of pillars, untouched by death and destruction. Or “harvesting” as some might call it.

Over the course of the day,  pillars bowed to him one after the other, unable to escape his omnipotence. He noticed a fulfillment in their submission, like the power one feels when the allotted tasks for the day fall like lowly dominoes. But who needs little dominoes when the flick of a switch brings a 60 foot tall monolith crashing to the earth. Power is enjoyable. It wasn’t his to question the nature of his power, that was not his role, he was only to wield it as ordained. Everything works best if you do what your told.

The nature of a master is beyond a slaves question.

For 5 days this happened. 5 cycles. 5 repetitions. 5 warmups and cool-downs. 5 fresh jumpsuits.

Reaching to grab the handle before his head he lowered himself into the harvester, noticing a tightness by his bicep. The annoying irregularity felt like a rock embedded in his suit.

Recalling the protocol imprinted on the door of the clothing module stating, "Return garments to module immediately if disfigured," he climbed out of the cockpit, down the stairs and took it off. Placing it back on the rail, he felt the piece once more. He rubbed his thumb over it like it contained a genie. Something about the feeling of it made him feel disfigured.  Like he's shape-shifting but he's not the one holding the controls.

He couldn't help himself. He grabbed it off the rail and looked around for something sharp that could tear the fabric. Nothing immediately stood out to him but the water module in the corner. He stared at it for a few moments, outlining it's shape, then moved over toward it. He touched around the surface of it, feeling the sides of the metal counter bend downward and ran his fingers across the edge. Once they met the corner, he felt a sharpness to its point.

Naked, he knelt down and pressed the arm of his suit up against the bottom corner of the counter. He gripped hard and ran it back and forth vigorously, until he could hear the tightly knit fibers give-in.  He pulled at the slit, tearing at something within himself and reached inside. It rendered him a small smooth white brick, black indented dots across its surface.

And on the fifth day, God created every living creature that moves...according to their kinds.

He dropped the fifth suit to the ground and sat back on the cold floor perplexed. He held it so close to his face that it almost absorbed into his brain. Speaking of, it captured all of his attention for some reason he couldn't decipher. Like it was a key. But within himself he felt the desire to look away and also to look deeper. Like two magnets sat opposite his metal body.

What is this?

The tiny piece revealed none of its secrets to him. One, two, three. One, two, three. His thumb moved back and forth over the black indents on it's surface. In the recesses of his mind, he could feel the weight of three beings like they stood behind him, or lie below him, but in this moment, he had nothing to connect them to, he pressed into them but there was no link. Their memory had been extracted.

In the blink of an eye he found himself floating high above the ground in his harvester, nearing his most recent clearing. Though the orange terrain wasn't always decipherable at a distance, it looked as though the road he had begun to mold continued off on its own accord. He lost it past a curtain of thick pillars. That was enough for him.

His arms never pulled back on the wheel.  The clearing rolled past him. Without so much as a thought, he continued on like involuntary compulsion. Whether he even recognized it or not was unclear.

Something about the distance. The weaving road continuing to somewhere afar. It spoke to his soul with an alluring tongue. It was as if there was hidden treasure beckoning him, and his heart was a homing beacon.

The unridden road tipped downward and hugged the edge of a steep ridge. From it's peak and high up in the cockpit, he could see over the tall pillars that dove below into the depths. Never had he seen so far off into nothing, the dramatic terrain littered with pillars, appeared to flatten until it disappeared into infinite. No shapes were clear at that distance, but he did notice something strange.

He paused, the air above the flatness was an ominous swirl of colors. It was only slight, undetectable to most but a seasoned eye like his. He lingered on it like it might burst forth at him like a monster in waiting but it felt frozen as he let his eyes scour it's waves.

He felt little holding him back now. The subconscious decision to break free of his rhythm unlocked something inside.  It also seemed to unlock this strange terrain he was so used to ignoring.

The unkept trail winded before him, now declining against the side of some vertical face to his right. It tilted heavily in the opposite direction at times so far that he could see the tracks to his left instead of through the glass floor.

The pillars were thick in almost every direction, virtually untouched.

I wonder how far I can get.

Only moments later, the display in front of him strobed bright yellow, accompanied by a small whining noise inside his control space. OUT OF RANGE. PLEASE RETURN. OUT OF RANGE. PLEASE RETURN. The words scrolled endlessly across the screen until he grabbed his ration bag, poured out it's contents and slipped it over the nuisance. Silenced.

He sped up, and weaved through the pillars and corridors of dramatic terrain, obliterating small obtrusions and occasionally cutting a pillar or two when no other route was available. His eyes bounced around every corner of the cockpit like someone through a rubber ball. An over-the-shoulder observer may have asked the question, "What are you looking for?" And have been ignored altogether.

He failed to notice the atmosphere above him, dimming quite quickly, but continued on in mindless single-mindedness.

The pillars started to grow. They loomed above him like frozen parents. The density became too much for his pace, forcing him to saw continuously, like wading through a thick substance until he met his match.

There before him were the three largest pillars he had ever seen. He leaned forward to see where it ended but it seemed to continue forever into the ether. The rightmost, had fallen but now lie against the other two. Just by looking at the base of the pillars, he knew his grippers could not hold such monstrosities but he studied their nonetheless now that he didn't even have enough space to turn around.

Examining their shapes, the now limited light came back into his attention, deceiving him to worry time had passed even faster than it had. His body was as still as a rock while his mind perused the realm of possibilities.

Like a flash-flood of light, the king pillar before him lit up his entire view with a sharp sound that pierced the impenetrable walls of his machine. Every muscle clenched in his body. The air inside was always silent but somehow this broke through.

Like a flipped switch, the pillar took on a liquid whiteness crawling up the angular protrusions coming out of its main column. It was the most incredible site he had ever seen. Shifting shapes floated like bubbles from its body.

That can't be good. He was brought back to his senses by the abnormality of the experience and his heart started racing.

Pulling back on the wheel the massive mechanism, responded after a short delay and began moving.

Like it was mirroring his movement, the enormous pillar released its grip on the heavens and started to silently bow toward him.

OH SHIIIIIIT. He pulled harder on the wheel. OH SHIT. OH SHIT!

It crashed right in front of him and shot small shapes straight toward his view. It shook his machine and creating the second sound he had ever heard from within it, a dull roar bursting forth from the ground beneath him. His breath burst forth from his lungs in a similar fashion, while relief poured over him.

Only a few seconds later, the machine still moving backward, it ran up a short incline like he sat on top of some large mass. It high-centered the large mechanism leaving it stuck high up in the alien atmosphere. There was no direction his tracks could move him, every button simply vibrated the machine but didn't send it anywhere.

An idea occurred to him. He could feel the delicate balance he was perched on, and considered that maybe just maybe the movement of the enormous saw could send him here or there.

This isn't going to be easy. He thought to himself, considering the saw would need to be extended in the forward direction or the entire thing could tip to a side, causing it to rollover and be uncorrectable.

Thinking and preparing himself for the maneuver, he felt the hairs on his head start to lift. Before he could reach to investigate, another burst of light lasting only an instant illuminated the glass around him and even rippled through his body with a slight tingle.

Only seconds later, it repeated, even louder than the first. The display before him lit up red, and oscillated between intensity levels while a voice audibly repeated, "POWER ISSUE", "POWER ISSUE".

He had no idea what that meant, but looked down and noticed through the glass in the floor, a different view appeared. It was slowly returning to the orange shapes he was used to, but looked far more like his pod, or the inside of the cockpit or even his dreams. He leaned forward to look down and saw a being. A being that looked  like he felt he looked himself. With parts like him, but also quite different.

It hung like a rag doll out of a machine with what looked like the same interior as his. Though it's face was red with blood. It lied motionless below.

The orange closed in on the alien world and returned to distilled shapes with far less detail. Instantly, adrenaline coursed through him, he felt a connection to that being and was not about to let it disappear. I have to do something. He spun in each direction, eyes scanning the walls and surfaces surrounding him. Nothing appeared to give him any clue, until he looked down to his left. There, a small lever had the words, "...this lever can be twisted to open the hatch...".

# Part 6

The glass clicked as it tilted upward. A hostile wind hit him in the face.

The world around him was far different than the glass had shown him, strangely familiar. Though his adrenaline called him not to admire it but to move.

The delicate balance seemed more affected by the wind than his own weight moving around the machine. He was able to make his way down climbing the tread of one of the tracks like a ladder laying against a wall. The ceaseless wind was trying here and there to distract or deter him but he continued on.

From the outside the machine below looked nearly identical to his but had a different scattering of numbers along it's side.

He landed on its track and could see the arm of the being hanging up above him. If the wind were to tilt his machine largely to one side such that it slid in that direction, the arm might be crushed.

He climbed up the track to get to the point where he could climb up to the being. Tiny sharp crystals cracked under almost every one of his steps as he moved. The crash had misshapen the bottom machine to the point where the cockpit was now bowing downward at a steep angle.

He was able to find footing as he tried to climb the indents on the side and emerged over the opposite side of the being into it's cockpit.

Hello. He shouted over the growingly fierce wind and whining of the perched heavy object above them. HELLO. Can you move! His shouts made no difference, the only movement came from the wind whipping its long dark hair back and forth.

He lifted himself up using the precipice of the cockpit where the glass once met the body and flopped across the edge like a used towel, growling in pain. A gash across his hand sparkled with tiny crystals like a rare red jewel. He pulled it the pieces, whincing.

He now sat only a foot away from the being on the edge of its seat.

It's shape was like his but different, though it's suit disguised it, he could tell from it's size and the the size of it's hand that it was smaller than him. And nothing was frightening about it.

He leaned over and slowly pressed the floating tendrils of hair away from it's face. What they revealed to him, astounded him to his core. Something awakened deep inside himself. This being was beyond belief incredible.

Reaching across it, he softly touched it's head, wet somehow. He turned it toward himself. It's eyes remained closed but the opposite side of it's head revealed a ghastly mixture of blood and hair streaming down onto it's suit and the place on the machine where it had rested. He drew back within himself knowing inherently, the severity of what had happened.

The position they were in was growing very hostile, and the wind was slapping them back and forth. Without hesitation, he shifted to the edge and looked below. I think I can get it down.

For a few moments, he crouched in front of the alien. Examining it's shapes to determine how he might move and lower it down without hurting it moreso. His focus was intermittently interrupted by the shear sight of it. It took all of him not to simply freeze and admire it.

Snapping free of it's aura. He had a plan in mind.

He grabbed one of its arms and turned it so it faced the edge of the cockpit and then lied it down across the seat. He examined the edge of the cockpit, the same kind of spot where his hand had been gashed, littered with more tiny knives. He kicked these off with his boot one by one and then felt it for any remaining pain points. It was clear.

He then lifted the alien up and sat it on the edge with it's legs dangling freely in the rough wind.

He stood behind it, crouching slightly below the enormous piece of machinery looming above them. He then took it's arms and held them above it's head and pressed it forward with his knees.

It slid off the edge with minimal effort forcing him to grasp as tightly as he possibly could to keep it from falling down. The adrenaline was now fully coursing, giving him the additional strength his week muscles were in such need of. Leaning at the waste, he was able to loewr it almost to where it's legs touched the track below, but it wasn't enough. Still grasping as tightly as he could, he crouched slowly, until his midfront was pressing on the edge. It's body was now halfway collapsed on the track, but he was afraid it's head might hit hard. He let go with one hand to get more distance and then was able to finish setting it as softly as he could.

Utterly broken he hung over the edge, looking down at it's helpless form below. He felt as though his body wouldn't move anymore, and he closed his eyes. The shifting grayness above him roared. The crackling sound bounced off the dramatic terrain like a glass room. It brought to his attention the ounce of energy remaining within.

He lowered himself over and down the edge and landed next to the alien.

Getting below it and starting on a knee, he was able to lift it up with a great struggle and a gutteral sound.

These tracks were smaller than the ones on his machine and he was able to jump off them onto a nearby rock outcropping. The pillars surrounding, didn't feel like enough cover from the angry force above them, so he took the being below the two machines, between the tracks of the lower one.

After getting fully underneath, he collapsed next to it with little left inside him.

Now that he had touched the alien, he just wanted to hold it, not only for it's protection but for something else. Something he needed so desperately but had been starved of for so long. He wanted to scream but did not have the energy left.

At once, water came flowing down below the machine at the same time it came from his eyes. He gripped the alien tightly, pushing aside its hair and held its head close to his. Slowly moving closer until it's forhead touched his. His eyes recessed, and he pressed his brow low, the tears and water poured out.

The hair on the alien started lifting and again the light burst happened, louder than anything he had ever heard before, striking the mountain of machinery they lied beaneath. He held it close, not knowing what would happen.

For hours this continued.

He was able to fall asleep a few times but woke at the sound of every strike. And when his eyes cracked open, every time he saw a shape in the darkness at one of the openings. It stood, four legged, disappearing into the darkness as the light flashes dissipated, but eyes piercing through. Watching, and watching, and watching him. In these moments, his mind existed in the thin space between dream and reality, and dream kept dragging him back into it's clutches.

A particularly violent light strike woke him while the air was rushing back and forth vigorously. It commenced a loud roar above. The sound of machine upon machine. Slowly gaining speed as the top moved forward. It crashed forth at the front side, resting the front of it's massive heavy tracks on the ground with powerful thud.

The alien was still motionless.

Instead of fear, he recognized the opportunity. Now his machine was free to move around, but the atmosphere was still very tumultuous. He rested his head back down, with atleast now a plan.

# Part 7

His clothing made a strange sound as his movement peeled it from the sticky ground. More light now entered the area through the middle of the tracks and the air had returned to the stillness he first experienced.

The alien, still lifeless, had missed the entire commotion. Though probably for the better. He thought.

He crawled to the opening to have a look at the surroundings. The pillars, now very different things, lied about in chaotic positions, here and there. Even large rocks seemed to have been thrown from their perches by the previous nights tempest.

He stood and walked around, the sky still grayish but now cracking and shooting lazers of light upon various spots of the hillside. The terrain arose on either sides of him like a curled piece of paper. They were coated in what looked like thick green clouds emerging from their stems. Together they created an impenetrable wall of color, only breaking for large patches of red ground and rocky outcroppings like shelves placed high up on the wall.

The sight was all consuming but familiar to him in the way it was when he first emerged from the cockpit of his machine. Almost a feeling like he had seen it before.

His machine still sat up on the smaller one, but at a much more dramatic angle. The front of it's tracks now touched down to the surface where he believed he may be able to drive it off.

Let's give it a try! He said to himself. As if anything made much sense in this moment. He figured why not return to something that felt sort of familiar.

Climbing the mass of bent metal, he made it to his cockpit. The cocoon of the cockpit was now almost completely filled with water up to the point where the opening in the glass was. He slid his lower half down into the water and stood on the wheel as he strapped himself into the seat. Hanging in that awkward position for a moment, he almost felt weightless. Then he shifted the lever to his lower left and the glass slid to close the opening.

He spun up the machine. And with no small amount of force was able to move the tracks, pulling at the soft ground over and over until the drew it forward and dropped the back half like a maimed giant. The water rushed over him but quickly disappeared through some hidden holes down in the floor. He was now level.

After repositioning it closer to the alien, he lowered the cockpit to it's true resting height and stepped off onto the track. We're going to get food, he said as he lept down to the alien and started lifting it into his arms. He managed to get it into his machine beside him by leaping from the smaller tracks of it's machine to his with it in his arms, and then started driving.

It's body was difficult to manage as the machine bounced and jeered in different directions, scaling rough terrain, but he kept the alien lying across his lap.

The route was clear to him because of his determination when he had trailblazed it. He didn't spend time weaving, but essentially had forged a path as straight as possible and the barriers he had to break through, were still visible even after the storm had ravaged the terrain.

It's head, resting on the side of the cockpit, turned toward him with a different sort of motion. It caught his eye and he stopped the machine. He placed his hands on either sides of its head and lifted carefully. It's eyes cracked open slowly and mouth barely shifted shapes but nothing came out.

Hello! He said longingly. HELLO...

It gave no response, and appeared to fall back asleep. Again, it was a sign to him to take action and he pressed forward at a greater pace.

They neared his pod, dodging many fallen pillars. From afar, he could only barely see it but could tell something was wrong. Ahhhhh, he uttered. Nearing, he saw it. The large stack of pillars he had harvested had crushed his pod. Through the orange, it looked like a strange sequence of shapes protruding and folding in and out of itself.

He pulled the lever.

He stood in the cockpit high above the wreckage, staring down at the mass of chaos. The top had completely caved in, and the water module was spurting it's dying breathe.

He just stared, at moments, thinking he should do something, but nothing coming to mind. He couldn't even move. His home was now nothing but trash.

The ground met his boots and he approached it slowly. Like the water module, light flickered underneath a few resting pillars.

The deformed airlock still partly covered the opening. He was able to climb one of the pillars and get to it. He pulled it up but to no avail until he leaned on it with his weight. Breaking open, it held on with only one hinge.

He crawled through, below the opening and a huge pillar looming above, no lights turning on for him. The inside still felt strangely clean, but so deformed he had to stay crouched as he dodged the protruding ceiling. The scanner in the hall was cracked and shooting tiny lights into the darkness.

Without too much trouble, he gathered the rest of his daily rations, until he noticed his bed was lighting up with a dull green every few seconds. Across the opposite wall from it, he noticed a few words floating across the folded surface. "EAVE"..."EAVE NOW"..."FIND TH CREATU"..."FIND TH CREATU". Though they were broken, it wasn't difficult deciphering what it was saying, only difficult deciphering the meaning.

Why is this telling me to leave? What creature? WHO is telling me to leave? The questions floated through his mind.

There was no way for him to gather water here, so he took what he had. Exiting the rubble, he felt a tug, not on his clothing, but inside. Like someone had tethered his heart to the pod. Like the only thing he knew, was now gone. Feeling a pit in his stomach, his eyes caught the face of the alien lying helpless in the cockpit. Orange light now illuminated it's restful face, spreading new light to the corners of his soul. It was clear to him that this was better somehow. That everything else, was now second. Had been replaced. That new meaning was somehow here. And it was that. It was this unknown being, but somehow known again, like a place he had been before.

His finger outlined the shape of the little white block on his leg.

He climbed back into the machine and was off. To where? He didn't know. But something about "the creature". Something about a creature.

He drove back into the areas he had cleared his eyes scanning the rubble and emptiness. Like potential had been plucked up one at a time. It held his gaze for a while as he continued to roll past it.

A chaulkiness in his mouth reminded him of his need for liquid but he had none. He looked down at the other and noticed cracks forming on it's lips, it must need liquid even moreso than I do, he thought, stopping the machine to consider. But where can I find some?

He opened the hatch, and felt the warmth blanket him as it revealed the new days light. He felt the aliens head shift as it responded to the feeling of it, and looking around at the incredible surroundings, decided that maybe if he just walked in a direction, he would find something. There weren't many other options. He tossed the pack of rations down to the ground and within a few minutes, was able to get them both down as well.

The ground felt soft and wet below his boots. The moisture seemed to him, a good sign, that maybe they could drink it if he could find more.

Hoisting the alien into his arms he was off, in the direction of the light streaming through the new pillars, not sure where he was going.

Afar off, he stopped and looked back. Barely through the density could he see the ominous machine behind him. He looked at it sternly like he may never see it again. And that was okay.

Returning his face to the sun, the rays streemed into his eyelids with a comforting warmth and he put his foot in front of the other. In the new direction.

An hour of walking flew by with the time between breaks growing more frequent, his need for liquid was becoming very apparent and even moreso for the helpless passenger as it's quiet breathing had grown to sound restricted. Like trying to breathe through the fabric of his body suit.

He sat below a pillar, shading them from the draining heat and recognized a smell.

It felt fresh, inviting, but suttle. It entered, like it owned the area and lingered. Tiny rustlings also came to his eardrums, like spilled crystals. It drew his gaze toward a lighter area in front of him, through the pillars ever present covering.

The soil curved downward there.

He hoisted the alien back into his arms, feeling his muscles grown with thirst. And his leg buckled but he caught it with his lingering strength.

One foot in front of the other.

The curvature bordered a 10 foot wide crack. Like the planet had forgotten to connect here. As he neared, the sound and smell grew. And the air took on a slight stickiness.

There lied in the crack, the tiny crystals. Ever spilling.

He didn't even think about the warnings of deadliness he had received in the forever ago. That this place was venomous in every way. Its beauty had already started to shake that idea like a toddler's doll. Unraveling the truth like it could never stay raveled.

Lowering to place the alien on the edge of the crack, he almost toppled over into the liquid. But he set it down and then conceded with his momentum. Making a splash as the rubber wrecking balls on his feet collided with the liquid. Fully collapsing into the flow, he started laughing. Like it was all a game, as if he knew anything about games. A spirit lifted his spirits, returning some ounce of himself.

In that moment, this scenario felt all too familiar. The clash of the senses was so powerfully inside him. Somewhere, that even his bones remembered. Like a grainy television screen, he saw this crack in the earth, but different, surroudned by different pillars, but everything else so similar. He felt a presence there, in the murky daydream. He felt it like it was there with him now. He tried to paint the vision in detail on the back of his eye lids, and slowly found some success. The outline of the being, was the same as that of the one he saw during the storm. Standing powerfully between the large tracks of the aliens machine. He now saw the outline of this same creature behind his eyelids, and felt like it sat once again on the edge of the crack above him. As it once had. The image, in his minds eye, started to flicker, like a glitch in his brain.

He opened his eyes, fully expecting to see the glitch upon the edge of the crack. But it wasn't there. In it's place was this new creature, more like him.

Crawling up the edge of the small bank, he neared it's face. It's lips were now fluttering but face blank otherwise. He pulled it toward himself, holding it's upper half while it's legs slid down the small bank and touched down into the coolness.

He rested its top half on his folded legs and let the coolness pour the two of them freely. Cupping his hand and dipping it, he brought the crystaline liquid up and poured a small amount over it's cracked lips. The movement of it's lips grew larger, as the liquid entered. It's head tilted toward the gift.

The alien winced, as though the liquid went down with some pain as it bored through it's throat, bringing freedom back to the air tunnel.

He held it closely. Closer than he had held anything before. Like if he held tightly it would re-awaken faster, or to a world better than it once was. Because he was there now.

A sliver came to the aliens eyes as it let in a small amount of the light. It appeared to trace the outline of his head against the powerful yellowness until detail came to the terrain of his face and their eyes created an unbreakable pathway between them.

Hello. He said, as quietly as speaking to his own thoughts. The brow on the alien raised a few millimeters as though surprised by the familiar response. He-Hellllo. It lingered on the heavy consonant, like waking up underneath a chainmail blanket.

He felt the soft hair on the back of it's head resting in his palm.

For this moment there was nothing else in their world, it had been ravished. It had degraded, it was abandoned, and they were now separate, somewhere else. In a place where connection was possible, where the deep yearnings of their souls could actually be met.

He trembled in front of it's tiny words, like everything was now changing.

You - are - like me. He whispered.

Yes, I think so.

# Part 8

It's hand raised to meet his arm still gently suspending it's head toward him, and ran it's finger tips across his skin. Studying the texture closely. The aliens eyes opened wider at the feeling and a soft smile inched across it's face.

He noticed the deep blue portal of it's eyes, like he could enter into them.

He noticed it's smooth lips like the crescent shape in the night sky he had seen hiding behind the harvester's glass.

He noticed the softness of it's skin.

But you're different. The soft words emerged.

Yes, I think so. It replied, the small smile coming to the surface once again. It delicately stopped it's hand on his arm and tilted it's head to rest against it.

They stayed here weaving in and out of each other for a while. The crystalline liquid reflecting light beams, dancing across their faces. The liquid seeped into the corners and crevaces of their clothing like the new sensations awakened from the corners and crevaces of their souls.

His fingertips carved the outline of her face into the background, then her neck, until they could not cross a river of red. Another liquid. Hard and calloused, it clung to the side of her neck like dry paint and continued below the fabric border wrapping her neck. He gently touched it with his fingertips, and her face wrenched into a tight knot. But she didn't pull away.

He caught her eyes and without a word passed between them a look of remorse. But it quickly turned into something else.

Led by the strength of this connection, his hand grasped the tough lapel that held a button on her suit. It gave him permission to explore further, though neither of them really understood what that could mean.

The metal snap clicked as it was released. Releasing the alien's neck from it's tight grasp. There continued the red dried river.

Pulling down the zipper on the front of the suit, he could feel the veil being dropped on everything. It tangibly broke something existing out there. It felt like pure rebellion. As if truth itself was being released from it's prison.

It's light skin shown with a stark contrast against the dark fabric above.

The alien released it's grasp upon his arm and let it fall below the coolness.

The zipper ended and he gently peeled the side opposite the pool of redness away. It's contours continued there like he could not believe. He wondered why anyone would ever cover up such a thing in the first place. Valleys, mountains, forests, it's body contained them all, and in such spectacular equalibrium. Even the stur he had felt when the harvesters glass opened, and this new world was revealed seemed second now to what he saw here.

He let the coolness pour over it's exposed skin, mixing into a red potion that trailed off down with the liquids movement. The aliens breathe grew deeper and quicker as the liquid wrapped around it's body.

He twisted the alien to rest it's head on the bank beside the flowing liquid and slid the rest of it's suit off, boot, then boot. Red lines and dark clouds were painted across it's entire right side, making it clear to him why it was sensitive to his touch. He couldn't peel his eyes away from the contours and shapes of it's body. He sat there frozen, transfixed and silent.

Eventually the alien lifted it's arm toward him and he drew closer to it, within reach. He examined the recesses on the sides of it's mouth, like perfectly smooth little craters. It unsnapped the button holding the fabric around his neck and pulled it's hand back to it's side as though a pain emerged from there. His eyes checked whether it was okay and it answered barely detectable.

Continuing it's efforts, he removed his own suit as well, and set it on the shelf of ground above the bank. When he turned back, the alien was pressing up on it's elbow and squinted it's eyes closed to account for the pain in it's movement. He quickly knelt back down and assisted it's painful movement until it sat upright in the shallow liquid.

He sat down in front of it mirroring the crossing of it's legs.

The aliens breathe slowed, and brought forth a smile that became mutual and rolled into shared laughter at the situation, or neither of them knew what. But it brought an alignment between them.

He placed his hand before him and settled it on his leg, sliding it slightly, feeling the softness of it's skin. Then brought a hand to the side of it's face, which the alien responded warmly to, and tilted toward the hand, pressing into it.

"Why," he paused, "are you like me?"

The liquid seemed to thicken to a stop around them.

"I don't know," it answered, eyes settling to the side, "but I've felt you before," brow furrowed.

"What?" He leaned in.

"When I lie - at the end of a cycle - I...I experience things."

"Yes?"

"You, understand?" It said reluctantly.

"Yes. It's like, another, of this." It tracked his words. "Another..."

"...world." They said it together.

A soft breeze weaved it's way around them, the pillars shhhh-ing in response.

"Do you see them? The figures?" He asked.

"I do. But not anymore."

He was unsure what it meant by that. "Do you know them?"

"I...I don't know."

He picked up on it's defeated tone. "We should eat."

He stood, the liquid dripping around him, and pressed up onto the bank. He leaned forward offering a hand down to pull it up beside him. But the alien didn't respond.

It's eyes were faced in his direction. Silently, he motioned for it to come, and even waved across it's gaze, but nothing.

He understood. Reaching closer, he touched it's shoulder, "grab my hand." It did so and emerged up the bank beside him.

The strangeness of that experience jettisoned his mind into a state of unease. Questions arose in his mind as he gathered their now-dry suits and boots strewn about, and handed the alien's over to it.

"I don't want it. I like the warmth on my skin." It said.

"The boots could help your feet", he said.

It carefully outstretched one of it's feet and patted the ground, examining it's texture, soft in places though in some places tiny sharp things unpleasantly stabbed her soft feet. "Okay", it took the boots from his hands.

Hand-in-hand they perused the warm forest, the bag full of rations hung over his opposite shoulder. Their skin almost disappeared into the golden glow peaking low through gaps in the looming pillars.

As they walked silently, the electricity between their hands, the rhythm of their breathe, and the sound of their feet crunching forest detritus was a full conversation. But still, he could feel his lingering question causing an electrical short between them.

"You can't see me can you."

<Add a conversation here>

He stopped moving.

"Do you trust me?" He risked the words.

"Yes." It replied, centimeters of a smile creeping upward.

"Here we go!" His shout could be heard a second time against the rock walls nearby.

He lifted the alien into his arms and started to run. It let out a short scream followed by a trail of laughter as they dodged their way through the pillars. Their tendrils tried to create impenetrable barriers but he was able to cleverly maneuver them in a split second. Sometimes ducking below the swipe, the arms were catching and releasing fibers of the aliens hair.

The alien released it's weight into his arms along with handfuls of lingering fear. Warm baths of light washed it away as the remaining yellow flickered through windows in between the pillars.

In a quiet realm, their sounds echoed over the hills as the pillars listened attentively. Their laughter breathed life into this dying place.

The alien grew heavier in his arms and his goal shifted toward finding a soft place to lay it's soft body. Toward his left, a corridor of pillars ended with a bright orange layer of light painting the world. He turned toward, reaching it's opening and froze.

The aliens laughter haulted as she felt a tenseness in his skin. "What's wrong?"

<use the same description here as when I first described the meadow>

# Part 9

A silence crept across the green floor as he lowered the alien down onto it. It was an open space, flat, green, sheltered by pillars of different shapes and sizes.

Against the vibrant color, the aliens soft white and smooth shapes appeared more at home than anything he had ever seen. He felt like he had placed a star back in it's position in the sky. The yellow-orange blanket of light strewn across it added a certain peace.

Something about this place was all too familiar though.

"Where are we?"

"I think I've been here before." His words tentatively entering the space between them. He scanned it's green walls as if someone or something might emerge from the doorways between the pillars. But they released no beings. Only quietness. "You're safe here."

"Where are you going?" Replied the alien.

"Nowhere, I just want to walk this place."

"What do you see?"

He left the question in the air for a moment, while the his thoughts shifted into place. "I think it's more what I don't see. I know that sounds strange." Standing, "I need to look closer."

The large area to their right was pristine in the golden evening light accept for one corner. It appeared almost as if someone had moved something on a shelf that was always there. His footsteps closed in on it, sounding like wind as they pet the tips of the green hairs below. The corner looked less untouched. The chaotic greenness, though dense was resting upon the floor unnaturally. As though the tendrils should be climbing but had now fallen to the ground.

Within 20 feet now, he slowed. Naked red ground, lied amidst the loose tendrils. Its outlines clearly not characteristic of the surrounding area. Too straight. Too symmetrical.

Walking over the sharp green arms of the surrounding greenness, he stepped amidst its fresh dirt. His boots sank in deeper than they had before. His eyes scanned the surface of the area, but no secrets emerged from it's redness. Having walked most of it, he started back, near his original footsteps and caught a glimpse of something within one of them. He darted to it. Tentatively, he picked the tiny white object out of the cool ground and held it in the light now more sparse.

A hard white block. Reactangular. He flipped it and immediately a flush of tingles went across his body. On it's surface were two black divets.

"The glitch." The words involuntarily came out beneath his breathe but he didn't understand their meaning. It didn't give him enough. But he felt as though Whoever was responsible for what happened here must have been like him. And her.

_Her._

He looked back at where she lay and his eyes were immediately drawn to his right as something emerged from the surrounding green like a bullet straight for where the alien sat.

"No!" He screamed, and starting running toward the beast closing in far too quickly on the helpless alien. It's muzzle jerked in his direction and in a split second it changed it's course directly for him at deadly speed.

He stood like a pillar, rooted in the ground. And remembered.

His solidity stopped it in it's race before it attacked.

He remembered. The glitch. The fight. The house. He remembered all of it. But the hungry beast did not. It inched forward with it's muzzle low to the ground, growling intensely. White spears emerging from it's jaws.

"I know you." He stepped back slowly as it got closer. "Please, I know you."

As it passed over the indents where his feet were, it's attention was drawn down to the ground. It sniffed the imprints with precision, then stood with a completely different posture. Fangs withdrawn, it stepped slowly toward him, now out of curiosity and he allowed it to come to him. It smelled his hand. Then ran it's long pink tongue across his palm.

"You remember me." The walls were now down. He knelt to the ground as it's tongue slapped across his whole face. He was unable to even get a word out. He ran his hand across it's hair, much softer than he remembered the glitches was.

"You're not the glitch are you."

It stopped for a moment and stood before him.

"What happened?!" The alien called.

"I think we have a new friend."

"What do you mean?" The alien yelled as it stood and started walking in the direction of their voices.

"Follow our voices. I now remember something, there was..." He recounted his experiences with the glitch but his attention had completely shifted toward the creature walking toward him. The alien's body held such a unique enchantment that when it moved he could not help but take his eyes off of it. It seemed to sway so smoothly like everything else was gone. Like nothing else mattered. Like the world was beneath it. It's legs were continued into it's upper body with such a poise, and it's upper body commanded the attention of this whole world. Yet in this moment, he noticed something different. As though it's spectacular figure complemented the surroundings around it. As though together, they became one and became more. He thought of the liquid, how it bent around any obstrucion, like the dip on the side of the aliens midsection. He thought of the green fur coming from the ground, like the soft hair emerging from the aliens head, he thought of the golden light, emerging through the trees like the light emerging from it's eyes when it looked at him directly.

It reached it's hand, "Am I close?" But he was now fully hypnotized. "I think I'm close, are you there?"

"Oh, yes. Yes. Right here." He grabbed it's hand and tugged softly for it to sit with them. "Meet our new friend." He guided it's hand toward the beast lying next to them. It welcomed the new presence, and looked at the aliens eyes as it felt the thick fur.

"What is it?" It continued moving it's hand across it's fur.

"I'm not sure. But I think it lives here. In this world."

"Are there many of them?" It asked.

"I'm not sure...something makes me think there isn't. Something makes me think there's not much of anything here. Anything alive."

"Why do you say that?" It questioned

"Do you know what we do here?"

"What do you mean?"

"What we do every day."

"Umm. We collect pillars."

"Do you remember those rough walls you felt as we walked? That was the pillars. That is what we have been collecting."

"What are you saying?"

"I now remember, when I first met a creature like this one. It somehow called me out. Outside of the harvester's cockpit. It fought me. We almost killed each other. But I awoke and that changed." He shifted his position. "At the time, I was collecting pillars near the perimeter of where many of them were, so I decided to get a look at the cleared area. I found a spot high enough to see very far. And what I saw..."

"What..."

"There was nothing." The alien's hand ceased floating across the beast and it shifted it's hollow gaze in the boy's direction. "It was empty. Flat. As far as I could see. Nothing but my tracks over everything."

No response came from the alien. It was processing the information. It didn't need to respond, it understood.

He cut the silence. "I think we're destroying this place."

Again no response. The beast simply scanned the pillars, it's eyes as precise as could be.

"We should eat."

The bag contained a few options. None of which either of them had ever been particularly excited to eat. But in this moment their bodies would take anything. And so would the best. It watched closely as the options were sifted through.

"Do you have ration 3?" A few bags were hidden throughout the small pile. Ration 3, was also his favorite.

"The rice mixture?" He asked. The alien nodded with it's subtle smile. They both ate under the watchful eye of the beast until the alien squeeze a small amount of the mixture onto it's hand.

"What are you doing?" He interjected.

"I imagine it's hungry."

"Too hungry. You're going to get hur..."

"It's okay." The alien said confidently. It brought it's hand to the muzzle of the beast while continuing to run it's fingers across it's side. The beast took the food surprisingly gently, without causing any pain to the alien whatsoever. "Maybe survival is less important for it than you thought." The alien said. "What should we call it?"

"What should I call you?" The boy responded, a question that somehow hadn't entered his mind until now. It hadn't felt important. He hadn't felt any urgency, in fact he simply hadn't thought of it. The aliens presence was enough. And there's less importance to name things when there's few of them.

"I don't know. Why don't you tell me?"

He let out a quick laugh but could tell by her face that she meant it. "Okay." His head fell backward as he racked the cosmos of his brain for ideas. Eyes tracing the folds of the floating white spirits above them. It was then, a moment resurrected within his soul. A hand pointed had pointed towards the lights filling the night sky. It drew lines around his imagination, and the letters emerged from that memory and the softness of the voice he had heard. "Eta. I'll call you Eta."

"Wow. What does it mean?"

"I - I can't say I know. But I remember something." His eyes fixed on green blade between them. "I think it's important."

"I'll call you Phi."

"What does it mean?"

She smiled. "I don't know. But I like how it sounds."

"Phi and eta. I like that. What about this one?" Turning toward the beast still resting next to them.

"What about" the beast jerked it's muzzle in the direction of the hillside, lit now only at the very top. It lept up and past them with such speed they had no time at all to react.

# Part 10

By the time they had fully stood to their feet, the beast had ascended part of the hillside afar off and trailed off to the right side out of sight.

"Should we follow?" Eta said, voice fluctuating from the sudden shift.

"Where else could we go?" He squeezed her hand, still placed in his from helping her up. He leaned and picked up the ration back. "Let's go."

They moved as quickly as possible toward where they thought the beast had disappeared. Eta, surprisingly quick to him now that she was conscience and fed. She held to his guiding hand as they moved, listening to his warnings of changes in terrain, pieces of broken pillars lying dead in their path and holes of varying size.

The pillars stopped climbing the hillside as it grew steeper and left it exposed as it stood high above the area they were before. Above where the pillars stopped seemed to be where the beast had gone, but at this point they were only speculating where it had gone to. Regardless, they trudged on. The pathway turned more upward and the frequency of their breathe ascendended quickly like the elevation.

The absence of light was starting to make it difficult to choose footing well and Eta slid because he missed steering her away from a loose section of rock. "Are you alright!"

"I'm fine." She said. "Let's keep moving."

They stood on a ridge, overlooking a dip in the hillside. "I don't know where to go."

"Can you see anything?"

He focused on the thick darkness of the dense pillars. Assuming the beast must have descended back into the growth, but couldn't see any movement.

He pulled her in the only direction he could think of, continuing the arc of their movement over the rolling terrain at the bottom of the hill. But they didn't get more than a few paces before they heard a strange sound echoing down the hillside before them. It was elongated like the space between the source of the sound and them, but it held a power over their imaginations.

"What is that?"

His eyes were drawn to a point on the opposite crest of hillside where the faint silhouette of the beast loomed. "I see it!" It caught his gaze and then walked across a small section of the hill and then slipped into what looked like a 20 foot tall vertical crack near where the hill started to flatten at the top.

They were down the steep terrain very quickly and ascending the opposite wall. Nearing the crack, "Stay quiet." His voice now low. "I don't know what might be in here."

The crack was more than twice the height of them, and stood like a rock doorway into the hill. They stepped over a boulder blocking part of the opening and were able to stand with a foot or so of clearance to their sides. It turned around corners where barely any light now touched. Eta's hand steadied her movements as she stepped over large obstructions.

The path split into two directions. Without presenting the problem, he chose the one to his left that appeared more open. Holding her hand he led her in it's direction. Around one turn, he froze when he saw two tiny lights not more than 20 feet down the corridor. Startled, he kicked a small rock making a crackling that rattled down the hall, and two more lights illuminated.

"I think there's two of them."

"Do you think it's okay?" Eta presented the words ever so softly beneath her voice.

"I'm not sure." The boy, kept them still for a few moments as he considered what dangers the scenario might create. Movement of two of the lights interrupted his thoughts and they started to grow. "It's moving toward us." He wrapped his back arm around the front of Eta like a shield and held the other out in front. The eyes floated in the darkness until the dull blue light cutting through the air before him formed a strange shape around the lights. He recognized the form of the beast from earlier. Still though, he remained as it continued toward him. Nearing, he raised his hand toward it as it stopped and peered up toward his face. After only a moment, it leisurely turned back and started walking toward where it came. "I think it wants us to join."

Eta waited for his move. And they cautiously stepped into the deeper darkness before them. Entering the space of the second pair of eyes, the boy kept them a few feet away as not to startle the hidden creature. It was clear to him by now that these beings could potentially be dangerous, but the eyes only watched them as they found space to lie on the hard ground, then they disappeared.

The boy was a barrier between the beasts and Eta. "Will you be able to sleep like this?" He whispered into the nothingness, but no response came. Only then did the exhaustion within himself flood him.

# Part 11

The morning brought with it a new sensation. He could have slept indefinitely but he could no longer feel the right half of his body making it very uncomfortable to remain in the position he was. Eta remained still, her face now visible in what appeared to be early light, eyes closed and mind somewhere else. Neither of the beasts remained so Fi, curious, stood to see where they might have gone to. He kept his movements quiet as not to wake her.

Stepping through the corridor, with each turn the light grew brighter though it was never direct. It was only a short walk back to the opening in the crack, but he stopped to consider whether they might have gone down the other arm of the pathway. Stretching his leg as it regained feeling, he decided not to get too afar off alone and turned to the opening.

It stood tall and illuminated by the morning light, it could have been mistaken for a doorway to the afterlife. He rubbed his eyes and shielded them from it's intensity until the pain receded.

"Woa..." There below, and beyond, the planet folded into itself. The green pillars rose and fell with the hills until they flattened into a knifes edge. He wondered if infinite lied somewhere beyond or if everything just ended. The morning sun was welcoming, he sat near the oopening of the crack on a semi-level spot. The view, high above everything continued all the way to his left and to his right with no obstructions.

A tear crawled down his face and fell, landing on the dry rock below. He curiously touched it with his finger and felt the moisture then his cheek still wet. His eyes returned to the site so far from anything he had could recall ever seeing. It felt so real, like everything had been fake and now it was becoming what it was. But there was far too much to grasp in the moment.

Observing this realm, his eyes eventually trailed off toward the right. He had mistaken the stark contrast of the harvested areas for a continuation of the horizon and traced the line back as far to his right as it would go. A massive area of nothing. A tear landed on the back of his right hand. He didn't examine it. It was then he realized he was not alone. The beast from the day before stood looking as well. It didn't acknowledge him but joined in observation as though it understood the feeling.

"Fi?!" A voice echoed through the corridor.

_Eta must be wondering where I am._ "Out here!" He stood and stepped back into the doorway. She had made it surprisingly far and was almost to the opening. "I'm right here. Right by the opening. How did you make it all the way out here?"

"I remembered our footsteps from last night, and the walls are easy to follow."

"I didn't mean to..." He was stopped by her.

"I knew you didn't go far."

He grabbed her hand that was feeling the wall near him, "Come here. Watch the rock below you." He guided her movements and made space for her next to him. "If only you could see what I'm seeing right now."

"Describe it to me." She replied.

"We are high above the pillars. It almost looks like they go on forever."

"Mm," she murmured. "But you know they don't."

"What do you mean?" He looked her face over, eyes like blue fire in the light. He wished, if only they saw into him.

"Haven't you thought about it?" He wasn't sure where she was going. "What brought us here?"

"I - I haven't. This place has just been so much."

"What if there's more of us?" She asked.

Something about the question felt burdensome. As though it would cost him something he wasn't wanting to give up. "I don't know."

"What do you mean you don't know?"

"I just don't know!" He raised his voice at her and felt a bit of a fire inside that he hadn't before. "I'm sorry. I just don't know if I want to know." His eyes returned to the knife edge at the end of everything. The blue above met it with a stark contrast creating an appealing view. His eyes rested there until, eventually another layer of blue, not much different than the sky appeared. _What is that?_

"I think I see something."

"What is it?" asked Eta.

"I don't know but it's like what is above us, changes far out there." He squinted to make out the difference. Light looked to almost dance across the surface where it rested upon his discovery. It reminds me of the liquid we sat in. But it's endless.

"We should go there."

"It's so far," He said.

"Where else can we go?" She smirked, and a short laugh of his accompanied the gesture.

"Okay." He turned back to the view and began plotting pathways from here to there. Over the Fifth hill in his view, quite far away, he noticed something strange. A large patch of earth looked discolored, lighter than what he had seen. _Is that rock?_ He moved forward and knelt on one knee, the opposite hand above his brow, blocking the intense light and squeezed his eyes even harder, sharpening the image. "Looks like, a wall."

"You see something else?"

"Where the hills meet is low. It looks like a wall is between them." He knew it sounded strange, but hadn't the words to qualify. It gave him an odd feeling. Like something had hardened inside him.

"We should go!" Eta said joyfully.

He didn't share the feeling, but agreed instead. After they had grabbed their bag and slipped out of the corridor. They started down the hillside carefully.

Hearing quick footsteps the boy looked back and saw the two beasts now coming toward thme. They stopped before them, appearing even more ready for the travel than they were.

"Our friends are back."

"Oh good!" Eta replied.

"I think they might be joining us."

She giggled in response before nudging for them to continue on their way. Their crew had grown by two.

The rocky incline made slippery steps, but they still made it down fairly quickly. The beasts stayed behind them on the incline, but then started leading the way when it leveled out. Their muzzles hovering low over the ground, gathering data.

"They must always be searching for food." Fi mentioned as he watched them weave in and out of the wall of pillars that approached. "I don't think there's anything here to eat."

"We could give them something," Eta said after a moment of thought.

"We already don't have much for ourselves."

"I know, but they let us stay with them. And they are coming with us now. We have more mouths to feed." Their steps continued. "And we might find food."

Fi had little trust that would be possible, so remained quiet as his thoughts considered. If we each take two ration packs a cycle, we have about 5 cycles til we are out. If we give them the same we would only have a few cycles left.

"I don't know. I think we should keep them, but what if we give one to them right now, then see if maybe they already know how to find their own food."

"Okay." Said Eta, "But if after a day or two they can't, then we share."

"Agreed." Fi squeezed her hand to solidify their pact and stopped before the border of the dense pillars to take out a ration pack. He grabbed one without looking and yelled in the direction of the beasts. They were both out of site but came trotting back together.

The larger of the two stopped immediately in it's tracks and it's ears shot up pointing to the sky, eyes fixed somewhere in the pillars, it darted without any warning of to the left. The other stopped and watched, but never left to follow.

"What's going on," asked Eta.

"Shh." They stood still for 15 more seconds before a trotting figure could be made out deep into the pillars. It emerged at the point it left to return to the other beast. But it had something within it's jaws. "It found something." Whispered Fi.

"What is it?"

"I don't know, let's get closer."

The beast had placed the object between it and the other one and was now pressing down upon it with it's leg and plucking at it with it's teeth. Eventually it rose and looked at Fi and Eta as it chewed. The other repeated this behavior.

"They're eating it."

"Eating what?" Eta continued to question.

"I have no idea. I think was another creature. But that can't be, I thought we were the only one's here."

"Maybe there's more."

Something about that notion felt encouraging to Fi. This place had always an air of isolation to him, but the thought of even more living things out there made him feel less alone. Less like what he had done with the harvester had ruined this place. Maybe this place was more resilient than he had considered.

The beasts lost interest in the creature eventually and licking their lips and backing off, trailed off forward muzzles still adhered to the ground.

"Let's keep moving." Said Fi, he walked past the mutilated creature, observing the point off it's head and the colorful hairy leaves lying around it's little carcass. It was a mess, but it seemed important. As though it was signified change.

They entered into the pillars, fallen ones lying about or resting against vertical ones, others with hundreds of tiny pillars growing out of them. It was easy to mistake in the stillness, like nothing was happening, nothing was changing. But so much was happening so much was changing. Always changing. The floor between the pillars was littered with endless peculiarities. He had hardly gotten past the intricacy of the pillars and their far reaching tendrils floating in the air to notice what weaved within his feet below.

Green arms with skeletal like shapes spread out from one center position, tiny pillars 1000 times smaller than their larger counterparts, green fur taking over fallen pillars like a massive blanket. The strangest was these small circular white and brown saucers, suspended on a tiny mast. Pearing below, he could see slits rounding the mast in a perfectly straight circular pattern. They were scattered about in places semi-hidden.

Eta stayed fairly silent, until she asked, "what do you think we might find?"

"I don't know. This place surprises me." He replied.

"What about it surprises you?"

"Everything. I can't believe I had never known about it. I had gone so long without knowing."

"How long?"

"As long as I can remember I guess." He tried to recollect the days into some number but so many seemed to endlessly bleed into others. "What about you?"

"I feel the same. I really can't remember anywhere other than this place, but I don't think I came from here."

"How did we never come across each other out there?"

"I guess we wern't looking. I guess we weren't looking for anything." She said like a revelation of sorts entered the space around her.

"We weren't looking for anything," he said softly underneath his breath, as he crawled above an enormous looming pillar fallen for however long.

"What was that?"

"Oh nothing. Just...don't you think it's strange? Why wouldn't we ever stop. Just stop doing what we were doing, and go somewhere. Out into the pillars. Outside of the harvester or the home pod. Just go."

"Where would you have gone?"

"I don't know. To find something! Anything. Anything new." The thoughts were new terrain he was claiming within himself like the terrain he was setting foot upon now. Untouched for so long. "But I guess I didn't want to. Or maybe I did but didn't know it."

He grabbed the severed limb of pillar and held it in his free hand as he walked. He examined the shape of the thing and how it twisted here and there freely, of it's own accord.

They entered an area visible to where they had met the beast the day before but still a ways off.

"Oh!" Eta's hand slipped out of his and she fell to the ground. He turned, "Are you hurt?"

"No I'm fine..." She stopped as she sensed his attention shifting towards something else. By her foot she had kicked up a few smooth white objects, long and slender. He slowly reached down to touch them. He pulled on one of them and the ground covering part of it came with it. He fell back in fear, like he had been punched in the chest. Below the growth a pile of the objects formed a pattern. He leaned back forward to examine the strangety and concluded it resemebled the shape of their beasts. There was also layers of hair surrounding the objects. Something was very intriguing about them to Fi.

His memory returned. "The glitch." He said aloud. A cold wave rolled through his body accompanied with a heaviness in his stomach. He fell to his knees and clawed at the ground with his hung low.

"What's wrong?" Said Eta, placing a hand upon his back.

"Everything. This place is empty. There's nothing here for us. We destroyed it all." His eyes flooded with liquid and a stream began to drip from his face. It felt as though someone incredibly important to him had been torn away. His body loosed, and breathing slowed, _why does this feel familiar?_

"What about the others?" Eta said, trying to comfort him.

He wiped his eyes and opened them, immediately seeing a massive pink tongue coming at his face that he couldn't dodge. It left what felt like half of his face wet. He was unable to hold back a small smile. "I guess it's us 4." He stood and saw the other poised to continue moving on. It's gaze was encouraging in a way. It gave him hope meerly in the action of continuing. "Let's keep going." His voice took on a more positive tone. He looked back at the mess, _goodbye,_ a voice responded from somehere he could not tell, "goodbye my son."

# Part 12

Grabbing Eta's hand, they continued onward, at a faster pace than before. The beasts clearly could sense the new energy and were leaping onto each other and rolling hear and there as they maintained somewhat of a pace.

For a while nothing was said between the two of them, both lost in thought.

"Try to catch me."

Fi's head turned toward her then she took off in front of him. She jogged with her arms spread out forward in front of her, she darted from pillar to pillar, her feet rising higher off the ground to not be caught on whatever might be lying below her that she doesn't see. He watched her for a while with no desire whatsoever to stop her. The way her face looked made this world seem different. Like an abundance.

Eventually he circled around her potential route a bit further ahead of her. He synced the majority of his movements to her laughter so that she wouldn't detect his movement. He stopped between two pillars no further than an arms length apart. She approached until just close enough that he wrapped his arms around her right before she ran right into him. Her laughter floated upward and weaved in and out of the pillars tendrils. It floated back down to them as they stopped and the moment silenced. He looked her directly in the face and could feel her looking back though he knew her eyes didn't catch him. He put one around her and pilled her a few inches closer til their faces were no more than 6 inches apart.

"I see you." She said with words filled with breathe.

"I see you." He whispered.

"No, I - I can see you." Her eyes lit up as he hadn't seen yet. And her mouth opened wide in awe. Her cheeks were painted red as she covered her mouth with her hand and cried tears of new life into her palm. "I can see!"

"Wait, wait, wait..." Fi stepped back and leaned from side to side, and waved his hand. Her eyes tracked his every movement. "Ha! No way!" His confused face morphed into one of happiness like he had been handed an extraordinary gift out of thin air. He wrapped her into his arms. "I have alot to show you." He whispered to her. "Try to catch me." He said cheekily.

She was able to move much quicker now and kept up with him well. She stumbled a few times as they continued on.

The air moved switftly past them, swaying the tops of the pillars and their green clouds of leaves danced in the movement. They were able to move quite a bit faster now that they had four eyes available. The beasts, still led the way almost the entire time accept for when they trailed off on a more interesting scent.

"I don't know how to describe this place! There's so much to look at." She stopped and examined the surface of oen of the pillars, it's deep ridges running long down it's side. She followed it's grain down to the ground where green needles surrounded her boots then picked one up and held it close to her face. "Incredible..." She looked at him with a smile, then ran past him leaping up to grab green handfuls of the green shapes. "I can't believe I have missed out on all of this. I don't know what to say."

"I wonder why your sight came back now."

She shook her head with. "I don't know... But I'm glad it's back!" She continued off in front.

Something about the shift left him a bit uneasy. It felt too abrupt. _How could that happen?_ He pondered. How could something like just be fixed so quickly. _Could she have been pretending?...No, that would have been pointless!_ Many ideas floated through his head but none felt fitting until suddenly he recalled his question from the meadow.

_Who did this?_ Who did this. That stuck.

The words on the pods wall. The empty square outline in the meadow. Was the same being behind those as well? _What is going on?_

# Part 13

The pillars continued on forever. Fi started to feel a pain in his stomach. "Let's stop to eat."

"Okay!" Eta called from not far ahead, dropping the intricate green object she was holding to come closer.

He swung the ration pack off his shoulder and started sifting through it. "Bread?" He grabbed two and held one out twoard her.

"Perfect." She replied. She slid the substance out of the tight sleeve and held it before her eyes to gather data on it's qualities. Twisting and turning it in her hand, she focused on it with an admirable intensity.

"What is it like?"

"What do you mean?"

Fi delayed his first bite, "What is it like for everything to change in an instant?"

"Well don't you know? You were like me. Frozen in endless cycles. But then you were broke free."

He looked down at his bread. "I hadn't thought of that." Twisting the strange loaf between his fingers. "I guess everything is different now. There's no going back."

"Why would you want to go back?" She said, then took a small bite.

"No, I don't. I really don't. -- I just. It takes alot more out here...To live."

Eta listened intently.

"I wonder if I can do it." His eyes were magnetically pulled downward.

Eta repositioned herself to be closer to him then placed her hand on top of his pressing into the ground. "You saved me." Her gaze exuded hope though he was not able to look up yet. "You can do anything. I know it."

Her words resounded through the corridors of his soul and took root therein.

The beasts were no doubt getting restless, there entertainment having become placing each others entire muzzles inside their mouths or digging for what appeared to be nothing at all.

"Let's keep moving." Before his words could finish exiting his mouth, the sky darkened. A gray mass quickly hovered past them causing the pillars to shake. "Hide!" He pressed Eta deeper below the dense shelter of the pillars. The beasts were likely still visible from above though.

The object moved on quickly in a direction Fi did not think he had ever been. "I think we should follow it!" He yelled over the now diminishing roar of the soaring object and the residual chatty pillars.

"But it's moving very fast."

"No time to waste then!" He slung the ratoin bag over his shoulder and grabbed Eta by the hand and they were off. They speed through the pillars like wind and the two beasts jolted out ahead, excited no doubt by the sudden activity.

They started up an incline, leaping over fallen pillars, and taking large strides. They contined in the same direction though the object was nowhere in sight. At the top of the incline the pillars still gave plenty of cover. Fi looked around for a high point that might give them somewhat of a view. The hill dipped toward the right then rose again at a higher elevation where it looked as though there was a gap in the pillars. He darted off in that direction.

"Where are you going?" Yelled a confused Eta. Though he gave no response.

Exhausted from the quick climb, she declined to follow at the pace he moved, but let him go on ahead. For a few seconds, no sound came from over the crest of the high point, then a voice.

"Eta! Come here!" His voice gave the air of secrecy as though she were to enter with some form oof stealthiness so she did just that, and scaled it with a watchful eye on her surroundings. There up top, he sat nestled behind a large rock covering with strange patterns of white growths and soft looking green hards in concentrated patches like little clouds.

"Stay low," he almost whispered.

Past his head if she refocused her eyes, not afar off was quite familiar looking terrain. She huddled behind him to examine. She had not seen the area before with her eyes.

"That's my pod!" She exclaimed in awe.

He turned and looked over his shoulder, "really?"

She nodded, her eyes fixed past him.

She had yet to be confronted with the devastation she had caused to this place. Basically nothing was left for as far as they could see from the elevation, just remnants of obliterated pillars, shredded by her harvester and flattened by it's ominous tracks. Every square foot beared her powerful fingerprint. It brought the same heaviness to her stomach. She shook her head to relinquish the thought, recognizing his intentions were not to reveal to her what she was seeing.

Near the pod, the massive machine was hovering in the same position doing nothing noticeable from the outside.

"What do you think it's doing?" She asked, trying to prove her interest.

"I don't know. Observing?"

The structure was impossible to miss, pitched black against the reddish-brown ground and the scattered pillars. Apart from the contrast, a large stack of pillars, organized in uniform orientation lie prepped next to it. Though not as plentiful as usual. She wondered if it had noticed.

They sat still as the machine hovered still, waiting, as the seconds grew into suspenseful minutes. Then without any warning, it slowly pushed closer to the pod. A dull roar signifying it's movement. Once above the pods vicinity, it shifted til it was directly above the pile then unfolded 8 massive hook-like appendages from it's underbody and lowered til it almost perched atop the heap. The claws spread wide and lowered til they touched the surface of the ground, then penetrated the soil like butter as they pressed toward each other like a huge closing hand. Loud cracks resonated across the flattened terrain as the mass pressed into itself. The claws began to withdraw and lift upward. The space below grew and grew, until the pillars were fully consumed disappearing into the belly of the massive mechanism.

"Woa." Fi said under his breathe. "That's where they go."

The machine then hovered still again for a short time then lifted and banked in their direction.

"Hide!" Fi shouted again and they pressed into their rock shield til it had disappeared past the wall of pillars behind them.

"SpaceX." He said.

"What?" Eta said, confused.

"You didn't see it on the bottom? It said, 'SpaceX Collector'. On ours it says SpaceX Harvester. I wonder what that means." He pondered the idea as he stood and started walking back toward where they had came.

"Does it matter?"

"Of course it matters." He turned around and contined backwards, "Aren't you curious what this is all about?"

"Not really."

"How so?"

<Locked on ship scene>

He slipped into the bottom left corner of the enormous opening, like a rodent to it's burrow, then crouched and hugged the perimeter wall, hidden behind a large metal box as not to be seen.

Peering out, his eyes scanned every inch of the area for any movement, and sign of intelligent life. So much of the space was filled with the pillars that it was hard to tell if there might be something or someone behind them. It was also much darker in the space, the majority of the vast majority of the light coming from the opening, though a few light small blue light sources were scattered about deeper into the monstrosity.

He could hear the thud of his heart pumping while he held his breathe cautiously. After a few moments, it was clear no one or no thing had noticed him make his entrance, so staying low and moving slow, he crept out from behind the box. He moved quickly and tucked behind the next thing he could. A beam reaching high to the ceiling and traveling across to the opposite side where it met another. Tracing it with his eyes it called to attention even moreso how large the space was.

His eyes were adjusting.

Toward the back there appeared to be steps going up to another level, open to the area. A blue light was above what looked like a doorway. Nothing here was labeled, but it was the best he had, so quietly, trying not to create an echo with his steps, he darted again further into the space. Covering more ground this time and hiding behind the next beam. He peaked through a circular hole cut into a flange in the large beam. From this angle he could now see the entire back area. There didn't appear to be much on the lower level at all, other than more large metal boxes with shiny circular dots and shiny handles. He could now see that the wall behind the open area on the upper deck had a large glass window.

He was more lax with his movements now that it appeared nothing was really on the lookout. Still quietly, he left his spot and climbed the stairs, eyes observing everything around him like a hawk as he got higher. The window was placed such that if he took the leftmost side of the stairs, anything inside would not be able to see him. Ascending the steps, the safest spot to hide at this point was right be the door, out of view of the large window.

Unsurprisingly the rest of the space on the other side of the pillars was more of the same. Large metal boxes, wires, beams. Clearly this machine was made for transporting large things like the pillars.

He stopped and scanned the doorway, hoping there would be some way of knowing if it was safe before opening it, but there was no hints whatsoever. He swallowed and looked around once again. _I can't just leave._ He thought to himself.

The adrenaline boiled inside his vains and he knew what he was going to.

He slowed stepped even closer to the door and reached for the handle. He grasped it, cold in his hand, and winced while trying to slow his breathe.

He pressed it down.

But nothing.

It didn't move. Not even in the slightest, and neither did the door open. Pressing harder did nothing either.

"Kshhhhhh..." The sound came from the doorway, he crouched low to hide shield himself behind the decks floor, but wasn't sure where the sound was coming from.

_The door!_ A cool flushed over him as he realized what it was. It was closing. And quickly.

Without hesiation, he jolted to the stairway and floated down it bearly touching the steps at all. Then sprinted as fast as he possibly could. The gap now half his height, he dove for it. But a bottom metal plate lifted up right to meet the top door and he slid up onto it, his arm the only part of him outside. He pulled it back right before he lost it in the metal jaws.

_No - No_ "No. No! NO!" He carelessly yelled at the wall as if it would make any exception. His words rattled around the interior but no response came accept for his own echo. He was locked inside.

Fear set in.

The blue light was all he could see by now, accept for some natural light streaming in on the far left side up on the balcony. He ran to the stairway and up to the light and looked through it below. Almost immediately, he felt his body become heavier and the ground started to move away.

"NOOOOOOOO." He could see Eta, emerged from her hiding place, now running at the Harvester. "NOOOOOOOOOO." He hit the glass window with his fist. She got smaller, with everything else around her. The pod. The nearby pillars. The hills.

He pressed his wet face against the cold glass wishing he could slip through it. Threads of moisture stuck to it as he pulled back and rocked forward and back in agony. He knew there was nothing to he could do now. And he had no idea where he was going.

The glass went white without any warning and he couldn't see anything. _What happened?_ He looked out but nothing at all could be seen in any direction. For almost a minute he was quiet, hoping something would change. Then, as instantly as it had left, the view reappeared. But now nothing he knew was visible. The world took on a curvature and everything within it, was now reduced to intricate patterns of orange and brown. He could tell they were moving very fast because of the speed at which the world pulled away.

The green he had known was gone. Barely a dot on the sphere. The rest was red and orange, massive gray swirls grasped huge areas of it, and green lasers shot out of it. He was awestruck and heartbroken all at the same time. Reduced to nothing but cargo. To whom, and to where, he knew not.

He hadn't noticed the deep blackness he was now entering. The lights that lit up the night he had seen were now visible, but it wasn't night time. He asked himself if there would still be a night.

The sphere lost it's dimensionality and became a small circle, growing smaller and smaller and smaller. Settling into it's position amongst the other lights. He sank to the floor exhausted.
