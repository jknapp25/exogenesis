# Part 1

His home pod illuminated.

Indirect light slowly climbing the walls, a cheap replica of a morning sunrise gently inviting one into a new day. But he didn't know the difference, he had never seen a sunrise. He had never seen a sunset. Or even this sun.

He scrunched his face like used paper, forcing aside another dream too frightening for words, not that there was anyone around to speak to. After this many years doing the same thing every single day, it wasn't too difficult any more to get out of bed. The only thing that occasionally made it difficult was these dreams. They kept him in their clutches, holding on to him like a mother holds on to her newborn.

If he failed to emerge, after 30 seconds the sounds would start. At first a dull roar, growing louder until it became unbearable. Vibrating the walls. It only took once for him to experience that. A sickness or something had slowed him.

Today, he's out in time.

The small barrack was only meant to house one person. It contained a clothing module. A washing module. A cooking module. And a lounging module. Everything valuable is modular. It can be replaced.

His uniform for the day protruded from the clothing module. The same uniform as any other day, though not the same garment. The module held 10 garments and kept them clean and organized. No consideration needed. He was not put here to wash clothes.

The washing module, a faucet that could be mounted high or low, advised him to splash cold water on his face in the morning. It "increases alertness by 27%", the words printed on the counters edge urged him. He didn’t know what that meant, but he did it.

He had three options for breakfast. A granular porridge, nutrient dense, but hardly flavorful. A rectangular gelatinous substance with meat suspended in something resembling egg. Completely artificial of course, it all is. And finally, a distant cousin of wheat bread with a pinkish spread. None of these did he know anything about other than how they tasted.

The second one will do.

The pod was shaped like a T, the leg stubbier than the letter looks, was the only way in or out.

He finished his meal, put his clothes on and grabbed a day ration of pre-made liquids and foods. And moved toward the leg. He placed his hand on the wall, a scanner floating across it, a pointless security protocol for him, a useful health metric for someone somewhere. The glass wall before him slid upward revealing a few steps floating upward into a sort of cockpit.

The pod and the vessel shared the same feel. It would be reasonable to assume the they were carefully designed not to expose the user to any outside air, or views.

He climbed up into the cockpit, illuminated only by a light outlining the floor, setting his ration bag off to the side and flipping a couple switches warming up some sort of clever power source.

Pulling a lever down to his left, he noticed for the first time that he had never seen the raised text on the hard surface near the lever. "In the event of an emergency, this lever can be twisted to open the hatch when not docked to an airlock."

The hatch closed. His other hand floating across a display mounted behind the steering handles. He knew the commands so well he no longer had to look at the screen. After inputting the sequence, the glass around him changed opacity, revealing an outside environment far different than the inside of the pod.

The terrain was quite rigid and angular, though the immediate areas where the home pod was located were level. It was sparse, to his right and behind him the landscape continued off into nothingness but morphing ground. In front of his machine, maybe a quarter mile, one could see countless large orange-ish pillars emerging from the ground at varying heights. The tallest maybe 60 feet.

Pulling back on the steering module, the cockpit lifted higher into the air, he liked looking down through the glass floor to see the ground press away and the massive tracks below him appear. Out of habit, he tested a button on the right handle and the enormous pincers on the front closed, pressing again they re-opened. On the left handle he toggled a couple buttons and a 12 foot chain saw blade quickly spun up and rotated horizontally below the pincers. A green check appeared on the display with the word "operational".

It had been a few months since his home module had been transported closer to the pillars and by this time his tracks had created a very smooth roadway for him to follow. Pressing forward on the steering wheel, sent the vessel in it's direction.

He began to enter the area with the pillars. Though the machine he operated was very large, the pillars still towered overhead. Looming above at different angles, with gray clouds filling the space between them.

He didn't venture far into their midst, but oriented his machine facing one of the pillars. For a moment he paused, his head still forward, his eyes quickly glanced down and to his left, for a millisecond it felt as if something flickered within view. He shifted his head back and forth playing with the reflections off the inside of the glass. Clearly it reflected his light gray ration bag as his head bobbed with the jerking movement of the machine. That explains it.

He breathed in slightly deeper than normal and returned his focus to the pillar. From this close, it's surface had a strange texture, almost fluid.

Pressing forward on the steering wheel, again the machine jerked forward.
Right-button, the giant forceps gripped the base of the pillar.
Holding left index, saw roar.
Left middle finger, the saw entered view from below and slowly pivoted from left to right.

The pillar was now completely held by the gripper, holding a button under his left index finger, the gripper arm tilted toward him, gaining speed as the angle increased, until a deep thud rocked and rattled the vessel.

He pressed forward on the steering wheel moving his vessel forward over the remaining base of the pillar.

The hours passed while he repeated this, losing his consciousness in the repetition. A sound woke him from the hypnotism. On the screen, "Take a short break."

He compressed a pedal near his left foot, the roar of the massive machine winding down in response.

Again he took a short breath, facing the clearing his eyes slowly followed the terrain out toward the horizon. So much space, completely empty. It made no difference to him what that meant, or if it meant anything. It's what he does. He knows no different.

A muffled growl came from inside his suit, reminding him of his hunger. Without looking he reached his right arm back to where he had set his ration pack, but felt nothing. Patting around, still the pack wasn't there. Twisting around, he didn't see the pack on the surface next to his seat, he remembered one time it fell down next to the wrap-around glass.

Shifting his weight, he leaned to his right and craned his neck to peer down. But clenched every muscle at the sight. The glitch appeared again. For a whole second his eyes stared directly into the ghostly creatures. The air fled from his lungs in terror. Nothing had ever gripped his soul so tightly, the eyes of another being. Fixed on his.

What was it?

He blinked twice, wiping his mind of the surrealness of what he had seen. The adrenaline coursing through his body, once he found movement, he became single-minded.

Leave NOW.

He tapped the display, it illuminated, sifting through a menu of buttons, he pressed one releasing the load behind his machine. The glitch was nowhere in sight.

He didn’t know the machine could move so quickly, in an instant he was docked at the home pod and climbing out. Placing his hand on the scanner, he froze. The air lock closing beside him. Finally he could re-capture his breath.

Sinking to the floor he recognized the feelings, he couldn't recall something so intense. Not knowing why, tears began to fall to the floor. That image, that terrifying thing, consumed him, burned into his sight.

His introduction.

# Part 2

In a windowless pod, there's no notion of day or night. His only experience of time came from the particular hue the outside environment took on towards the end of his workday. Other than that, the outside afforded him no secrets.

His head now buried in the steel sink, time was the last thing on his mind.

He splashed his face repeatedly, never thinking to ask himself questions like, “what is water?” or “where does water come from?”, the usual questions a 14yr old boy should be asking the world. Still, those superfluous concepts weren’t the reason he was placed here. Not that the science behind atmospheric water generation, would benefit him much right now anyway. In this moment he’s only concerned with the potential for the water to wash his mind of that image. And return him to what is real.

What is real.

Bold green words slid across the surface of the wall above his head, giving the metal bowl an alien fluorescence. He looked up, “You need to sleep.” The words slid back out of view to the left, and back in from the right. Until then, the thought of returning to the site, had not entered his mind. The last few hours were spent trying to forget what he had seen, the last thing he wanted to ponder was another encounter.

What if it re-appears?

Returning to his bed, the coverings were still saturated with sweat. Yet after a few minutes, he eventually found a corner of his mind to nestle himself into. And there, he found found something. Simulations.

> He was watching a boy moving quickly, leaping up tiny islands, deep purple and jagged. He was going up an incline, slipping here and there, the slow movement of the ground making the placement of his feet unpredictable. Chasing the boy was a creature, not unlike the glitch he had seen. In the dream, he could feel what the boy felt but it wasn’t the same feeling the being gave him.
>
> His perspective changed. He was now the boy, running, but looking back over his shoulder he saw the glitch. The creature’s terrifying yellow incisors slicing through the air, muzzle covered in dried blood. It pursued him, jaws agape. This now became a run for his life.
>
> He reached the crest of the incline, it leveled out but the trail dropped off to nothingness. He had nowhere to go. Terrified, he waited a few moments for the creature to emerge, but nothing. Nothing came over. He inched forward, peering back down the trail. It leaped up! Tackling him to the ground! All he could do was shield himself with his arms, expecting his flesh to be torn away, but there was no blood. Instead it caressed him with it’s tongue. Uncovering his face, he saw the beasts eyes held no terror.

He felt the vibrations tingle his skin before noticing any sound. Stepping onto the floor, the noise ceased immediately though it faded in his ear like someone kept their foot on a sustain pedal. His dream followed suit...

What was that? He asked himself. He juggled the blurry images in his mind, unable to re-call the full sequence of events, but was able to hold onto the feeling. Somehow he knew this feeling was important. A source of strength.

Immediately, he began his morning rhythm. His body going through the steps, while his mind explored an idea. Maybe he was mistakenly afraid. Maybe the glitch was not what he thought it was. Maybe he should return. The feeling grew like it was rolling down a snowy hill gaining size and momentum, until it resembled courage and even curiosity.

Truth is compelling.

He tucked his head to clear the opening of the cockpit and lowered down into the seat. He continued his motions as usual, pausing for a second before pressing the button that would reveal the outside.

The road to the pillars was rougher today, he imagined it must have shifted when he rushed back the day before. Part-way there, a large mass now blocked his passage. For a moment, he considered it an escape, his excuse to not go back, but his new-found courage urged him to try something. Spinning the vessel and pressing with the right track, he was able to nudge the mass off the adjacent drop-off.

After a quarter of the day had passed, he realized the pile of columns he had accumulated from today’s and the previous day’s cutting might be too large for his vessel to move in one load if he didn’t take it back to the pod soon. Deciding not to deviate too far from his usual rhythm, he reloaded the pillars, dropped them outside his pod, and returned.

Something about coming back after not having seen anything earlier released the tension in his shoulders and relaxed his constant scanning of his surroundings. He got back to work.

It was only a few minutes til he saw something moving between the pillars. Immediately, he stopped what he was doing and backed the machine away from the current pillar. Frozen in his chair, he waited.

And waited.

Like someone flipped a switch, the glitch appeared. He tensed. Directly in front of the vessel, it stood on four legs, eyes fixed on his, the same yellow teeth that chased him in the dream. More horrendous this time. It flickered only once for a moment, but otherwise stayed in view like it was determined to declare it’s presence.

Neither of them moved an inch for what felt like a lifetime. He observed the matted fur of the beast containing all sorts of debris, the blood stained fur around it’s neck, the protruding lines across it’s sides.

How is it still alive?

Maintaining eye-contact, he twisted his head slightly and tilted it to the left, bringing the lever on the floor into view. Cautiously bouncing his eyes up and back he re-read the words next to it, “…this lever can be twisted to open the hatch…”

His curiosity overcame any judgement.

Slowly he moved his hand down to the lever. Upon grasping it, the creature jerked it’s head upward while opening it’s jaws. This sent him tense again, not knowing what the gesture meant. Still he held. In the moment, he remembered something he had heard, “...if you enter the outside, you will die immediately. The atmosphere cannot sustain life."

Oh well...

The cockpit glass popped upward, and then slid back. The orange world he knew wiped away like a reverse painting. Everything completely changed accept for the creature, anchored to it’s position in the universe.

The sun stabbed him in his retinas. The pain was intense for a few moments, but receded fairly quickly.

The beauty of the outside sent his senses into hysteria. A shiver rushed through his body. He had never seen color like this, he had never heard sound like this, he had never felt air or the sun like this, he had never…

A noise interrupted his temporary transcendence, pulling him back to the moment. The creature, voraciously screaming was now closer. It was confusing what it was doing, but it felt important.

Looking down at the massive tracks below, he stepped over the side and shimmied low enough to drop onto them.

In response, the creature stepped closer, continuing it’s shrieking.

Slowly the boy moved forward on the track, til he neared the edge. The creature stopped it’s sound and froze, staring intently.

He crouched, peered at the mysterious surface below, then jumped down.

A pause, nothing happened, but only for a moment...

The beast exploded at him. Leaping for his face, tackling him to the ground. Thrashing and biting at every inch of skin possible.

The boy was defenseless, unable to land any blows that made an impact, but still scratching in his writhing. The blood began to flow. Both beings fighting for their lives with everything inside of them.

Finally, he shoved the beast to the side, seizing the opportunity to grasp it’s ratted mane and throw it against a pillar. It hit hard, let out a yelp, and collapsed to the ground. He also collapsed. Staring at the lifeless being while his vision faded into darkness.

# Part 3

The door closed loudly.

Her gait was slow as she approached the front of the room, her sullen face hung low. He scanned the room quickly as she approached the front, it was filled with others like him, but very different. Their bodies held different terrain, different colors, different hair, they gave off different feelings. And they all sat looking in one direction, facing one wall of the room. He did the same.

She had a black, full-body suit on, red angles above the hands like her arm was dipped in a bucket of paint.

Lifting her head to the group, her eyes panned from right to left before beginning. “I’m very excited to be the one speaking with you today.” Though her face showed nothing of the sort. “Today is very special. You are very special. Do you know why your special?” She stepped to her left, lowering her head and folding her arms behind her back as if waiting for a response. “Hmm?” Turning her head towards the group. “You represent the triumph of the human spirit. Everything it’s taken to get to where we are today. Courage, inventiveness, curiosity. And still, you are the future. This planet and the others the human race inhabits, is scarce. To sustain life, we need to look onward to new horizons. New worlds.” Pausing to settle the air. "You, have been chosen to do that.”

Confused, he thought, Chosen? I thought I volunteered.

“We are sending all of you on an adventure. To a new planet, where you will explore. And return to us with knowledge of it’s habitability. You are the future of the human race.” The words trailed off and fell on the floor, yet still some in the room seemed eager. "It’s time to begin preparations.” She winced slightly, masking the expression by turning and starting back toward the door. “Follow me."

His consciousness returned to him, his senses following at their own pace. Hands, then feet, legs, arms, then his head and neck. A strange sensation there. It reminded him of the dream from the night before. In his minds eye, he again saw the creature standing over him with an innocent gaze.

Still not reminded of his location. He opened his eyes.

There next to him was the glitch, it’s muzzle buried in his neck. The boy noticed, then retracted his head, feeling as though the creature was too close for comfort. To his surprise, it looked down on him with the same eyes as the dream. Eye's devoid of the terror they once had. Not sure what to make of the situation, he slowly lifted his hand to his neck as not too startle the creature, and held it above himself littered with streaks of red.

Immediately, he recoiled, shuffling backward on hands and feet, keeping it safely in view. It didn’t react, in fact it didn’t move an inch but just continued staring at him.

He sat there, poised to stand and run, but he couldn’t get himself to move.

The dust settled, and the creature carefully placed one paw in the boys direction, testing the situation. With it’s tail low and straight, it lowered it’s muzzle to the ground as if smelling a trail, it’s eyes catching his gaze intermittently.

It pretended to sniff the ground around his outstretched leg, then moved to his boot, and his torn suit leg where his skin could be seen red, irritated, and caked in dried dirt and foliage. It pressed aside the synthetic fabric, a couple flies disseminating, and caressed the wound. The boy winced, as stiff as a board, but recognized somehow the feeling was helping. The being was seemingly avoiding eye contact, but after a few seconds it started rolling it’s eyes up to the boy’s. Whether it was actually healing the wound he did not know, but he felt an unmistakable connection to the creature anyway. A doorway into a heart starved of relationship. The creature was not trying to hurt him.

What now? He thought after a short time taking in his environment. He could still tell from the amount of light, that the day was not even halfway over.

He pressed down on the ground with his right hand, leaning to regain some footing, feeling the pains of the death match from before. Arising, he looked at the creature, a gaze that somehow established a temporary truce between the two.

He stepped in the direction of the clearing he had made from the previous days. But was surprised by the pain in his leg, forcing him to limp. Upon starting, the animal shared the same ailment. Something about the two of them dealing with the same pain they inflicted on each other, sent a suttle laughter into the boys chest that grew until audible. It continued to grow doubling him over with the extra pain the laughing inflicted on his abdomen. Hands resting on his knees, he looked up to the animal a few paces ahead of him. It seemed to share a jovial look, with it’s mouth open, tongue hanging out the left side of it’s jaws.

Eventually gaining composure, he decided to look around a bit. He rounded his vessel, noticing a few words below the cockpit window. “HARVESTER” in big bold letters, and below in smaller red, “SpaceX”.

Harvester. He recounted, what does that mean? Being on this side of the glass, it felt strange to never have known much of anything about the machine.

He stood in the center of the massive circular clearing. 100 yards in diameter. Still and quiet, he looked upward amazed at the rich blue above him. He felt warm inside, peaceful, until he lowered his head back down.

The pillars, the things he had spent so much time cutting, moving. Now looked overhwelmingly beautiful. Their movement so soft and liquid in the slow wind. Their color so intense, contrasting against the blue above. But what he stood amidst, felt different. He only now realized that they were here, and now they are gone, because of him. Because of what he had done, day in and day out. He was harvesting beauty.

He needed to know the full scope of what he had done. Turning back, he purposefully passed the animal and the harvester and started down the road to where it entered the pillars. Reaching the opening, there before him was nothingness, as far as he could see. The terrain protruded here and there, but it was bare, nothing but pieces of pillars, corpses scattered about, the tracks of his vessel winding their way like endless scribbles through the rubble.

Like lightning struck his heart, he dropped to his knees and started sobbing. It was clear what he had done. There was no mistaking. He remembered the vision that came to him when he had fainted, “You are the future…you have been chosen…” LIES. Nothing but LIES. I’m no explorer. I'm no pioneer. No adventurer. I’m a murderer. Sent here to destroy.

The animal called to him. A shrill sound, that startled him. The creature seemed to have a way of bringing him back.

Back to reality.

He turned and stood, his tears leaving dirt trails winding down his cheeks.

The creature, a few yards back, stared at him with intention like it had when he sat in the cockpit but this time it felt as though it was beckoning his soul. It turned away from him and started back up to the pillars.

“Wait!” The boy yelled. Receiving no response from the animal, he wiped his face on his sleeve and ran to join his companion.

When he had almost caught up, it saw him and started running as well. “What are you doing!” He shirked his limp in favor of not falling behind.

It veered in a different direction, avoiding the area where the harvester sat. Taking them directly within the pillars. Beneath their cover, the light changed, confusing the boys simplistic idea of time. Deeper and deeper they ran, leeping over fallen pillars, shuffling up inclines, slipping on loose ground. The creature always staying out of his reach but looking back continually to check on him.

The boy felt as though his senses were on fire. The rough surface of the pillars against his hand, the smell of the green surrounding them, the soil compressing with his footsteps, the air licking his skin as he ran, something was awakening inside of him.

The harvester was now nowhere in sight. Nothing he had ever known was in sight. Everything around him was alien, the shifting light across the pillars green clouds confounded him, the soft green hair that covered parts of their surface, the unpredictability of everything around him. He found himself wanting to stop and just stand, but his companion continued onward.

They rounded a steeper incline tracing a contour line around it, then bent back the opposite way. The creature suddenly disappeared within a dense grouping of pillars, which he noticed, but didn’t slow his pursuit. Sliding into the grove of pillars, like an overfilled wardrobe, he went a few paces, then was stopped in his tracks.

The creature before him, have of it’s body down in some small ravine, raised it’s head to recognize his presence, it’s fur darker and thicker looking, then lowered it down again as if pre-occupied. The boy stepped forward to look at what it’s attention was on. Nearing, it looked as though a tiny crack, maybe 6 feet across had opened in the ground. Some gleeming liquid down in the bottom of it, followed the unpredictable twists and turns of it’s shape, without stopping at any point. He stood above it, absolutely enthralled by the concept. Questions arose inside him, “what is it?”, “where does it come from?”, “who turned it on?".

The animal consumed so much of the liquid, it just kept going and going. He found it so interesting that it could use the same part of it’s body to connect with him, mending his wounds and to shovel this liquid. What a peculiar being.

What could be so interesting about this liquid? He knelt down to it and watched it glimmer in the light. Tiny green ropes waded in it’s missed, tossed here and there by it’s movement. Looking again at the animal, he remembered the warning, “...you will die immediately. The atmosphere cannot sustain life.” And yet here he is, feeling more alive than ever before.

He lowered one leg into the crack next to the flowing liquid, then leaned, his hand hovering above it for a moment. A splinter of fear toward this world still remained. He lowered it below the surface, surprised that he felt almost nothing but a slight warmth. He played with the unnatural shape of his hand under the liquid as he moved it around. Recognizing the distortion. Eventually he concluded it must be similar to the liquid in his home pod.

Bringing his other leg down as well, he crouched by the flow, and lowered both of his hands below the surface, the dark brown haze of material releasing from his hand in chunks, revealing the true color of his skin.

He re-arranged his body to mimic the animal, thinking it might be best to consume the liquid the same way it does. The space between the liquid and the edge of the crack was not much though, so he had to get above and slide his head and torso down into it. He slid more and more, the liquid just out of reach, then slid down a little more. Losing balance, he flipped feet over head and rolled directly into the liquid catching gulps of it til he sat back up in it’s midst. He coughed involuntarily, the beckoning of himself reminding him of the creatures before. He looked at the creature sitting calmly on the edge of the crack and his coughing turned once again into uncontrollable laughter.

The stream of liquid, came up above his legs now, and he just let it flow about him. Fro, the laughter, the warmth of the brighness, and the warmth of the liquid it felt too good to get out. From this angle, all he could see were the creatures muzzle, the pillars above, the blue atmosphere, and the winding crack before him.

He sat, in it for a while, his mind wandering, something about the glimmering flow put him in a sort of trance. It felt easier to think. What have I missed out on? How could this have been here all this time? What is this place? Why did I think I would die? Where does this liquid come from?

Where do I come from?

Shivers rippled through his body. That was the question, he sensed it. It felt dangerous to ask it, but he didn’t know why.

Breaking from his trance, his companion was gone.

# Part 4

He hobbled up on two feet, regaining a sense of his surroundings. The creature was nowhere in sight.

Startled by his sudden aloneness, he pressed up on the edge of the crack and planted his heavy liquid-filled boot on it’s edge like the man on the moon.

Below him the shape of the creature was still wet on the ground, and he could see it’s steps trailing off into the thick pillars once again. He had no other clue as to it’s whereabouts so he started in the direction of it’s steps, paying careful attention not to lose them.

Never had he been alone in such a place. It felt ominous, overpowering. He felt as though he was at the mercy of his surroundings, as if there was a power he did not understand behind them. Placing a hand on each pillars surface as he wound his way through them, he started to feel a connection to this place. He pressed aside the pillars green clouds as they were before him, noticing the distinct scent they held, different than the scent of the ground.

He weaved his way through the pillars like a ghost. One eye checked the ground but usually sunk into the details of the pillars or the different shapes of the pieces making up the green clouds.

The pillars finally gave way to an openness, a spectacular green painted the surface of the ground, it was different than the green of the pillars. It stood low and was made of different textures. But the way the light was now licking it, created an incredible feeling. Like magic, if he had known what that was. The light felt fluid, thick and golden, like he could cup it in his hand or it would stick if he touched a pillars surface.

Lowering a knee, he floated his hand through the fibers. They reminded him of his hair in the morning.

He felt its eyes.

Across the small opening the creature stood away from him, silent but watching. Its body turned away. He wondered if it watched over this place. If it understand the shapes and colors. If it understood him. Somehow the creature knew he would find it. Turning away, it slipped into a dark hole in a massive overgrown maze of greenness. The tangle amidst browns and other greens felt chaotic but purposeful.

Floating his eyes over the chaos, he noticed above it all a red column protruding. It looked nothing like surroundings. He was surprised he hadn’t seen it before. It appeared to be made of red rectangles kept together by white lines. Atop it, a shiny cone focused the light toward him.

It felt like a key of some sort. To what, he couldn’t tell.

At this moment, it felt beyond him to betray the creatures trust, so he approached the opening slowly. Feeling the warm air move over his skin as he waded through rivers of full sunlight. Nothing stuck it’s head out, the glitch didn’t re-appear. So he continued, now realizing just how dense the growth was. Through it’s weaving he couldn’t see more than a few feet in.

The opening was no higher than his knee so he dropped, his hand pressing into the earth on top of the glitch's imprint. He felt it’s shape. Full body now flat on the ground, any reluctance to touching surfaces had wained after he had found himself rising from unconciousness like an unburied corpse. Though that experience now felt more like a birth than a death.

He crawled forward inch by inch through the tiny unknown, his elbows and knees flaring to the sides to somehow push him forward. A sharpness stabbed his knee as he brought it through the opening, looking down, his clothing was caught on one of the loose arms of the mass. It was lined with tiny spikes, and one was caught on him.

What is this thing? He thought, wincing while he reached back, releasing it’s grasp on his thigh. The voracity with which that one arm held him brought to mind his powerlessness in this moment. If it fell down upon him, no amount of thrashing or pushing could set him free. He would be consumed.

I can’t do this. A trickling fear brought him to a stop. It started to consume his thoughts. I can’t do this. A sting near his elbow, he was caught again. It set him off. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this! He writhed back and forth as the stabs spread across his body. I can’t! Tears and blood now flowing. Help. Help! Mamama. He mumbled audibly. Mama! The word burst out of his soul, meaningless to his conscience though full of meaning. MAMA…

An arrow struck his heart, the glitches eyes, it’s muzzle low to the ground at the end of the tunnel. It appeared frozen in time, unblinking, completely focused on him. He knew those eyes. The storm within died down. His breathe slowly catching up with him.

Who are you?, he questioned silently, though he heard the words like he spoke them aloud.

The air filled his lungs, I can do this. Arm pressing down and back, he didn’t bother with the web of vines now attached to him. Now the other arm, straining, their eyes still fixed. Eventually nearing the end, his captors relinquished their hold one by one, having made his movement far more strenuous.

The glitch backed as he stood and regained himself. Still conscious of his presence in it’s demeanor. It turned back, like returning to some previous task.

He glanced up at the creature, and the structure before him grasped ahold of his attention. Now within the chaotic web of green, the glitch ascended a few stairs onto a short platform that lined the front of some sort of structure. It’s windows were cracked and broken, green robbers now reaching their arms through the openings, giving it the appearance of being consumed by the world. The glitch paid no attention, in fact, it didn’t even turn it’s head to observe like he was. Surely it was familiar with this place.

Is this your pod? He wondered. Though he didn’t waste much time basking in the absurdity of this place, recognizing maybe the glitch had brought him here for a reason. He moved toward the structure observing it thoroughly with the reduced light available to him amidst the dome of overgrowth. It didn’t quite make sense to him how are why it could be here.

The first step groaned loudly below him like some dormant beast, and the structure only grew angrier with each footfall. Over the platform floated another level, three columns holding it with the last of their strength, one additional column in the middle had given way and now the overhang bowed before him. It was not like him to question origins but this structure seem to be at such war with the surroundings that he couldnt help but wonder how and why.

The glitch had slipped through an opening torn through the center of some mesh stretched across the doorway. Through the mesh and due to the absence of light, it was not clear to him what hid within, so he lowered to his hands and knees and slipped his head through. He blinked a few times thinking his eyes had betrayed him because the darkness released no secrets, but after a few moments paused in this position his eyes started to decript shapes and edges. It wasn’t clear if his friend was anywhere to be found.

Heslowly pressed his thin shoulders through the tear, and his legs awkwardly followed.

Agh! A sharp pain shot stuck the palm of his right hand. Investigating it, a tiny glimmering sort of rock was partially embedded in the skin. He sat to reach his hand back through the opening to use it’s light, then winced as he slid it out. Why does this place hurt so bad? He asked himself, thinking for a moment that maybe this world was at war with him as well.

He looked back into the room, the space appeared to grow to his left and right. A few feet in front of where he sat, a peculiar square lie, glimmering rocks all over it. He reached toward it, carefullly being sure not to touch any more of the shiny blades and they all fell from it’s frame, creating a startlingly loud noise. Within the square was something rivaling any of the strange things he had encountered before. On a piece of material were three beings. One’s that felt so different than any he had encountered. They felt familiar, in a way, like he knew himself. They reminded him of himself.

He had seen these beings in his dreams. Something solidified in the air. They are like me.

He slipped the image in his sleeve before returning to his surroundings. The place took on a new hue. This IS a home pod. Everything he saw, though lying in such disarray, felt more important. Like someone had placed a lense over his eyes. He saw those beings like holograms, moving around the space, in and out of it’s hallways. He saw them touch, run, fight, laugh, he felt more like a ghost than they did.

He followed one of the smaller ghosts as it ran down a hall and into a room. The hall was lined with some more images still hanging, some fell to the floor, glimmering rocks littered the ground. The room cast light into the hall and somehow beckoned for his attention, he floated his eyes across the images like glancing through scattered windows and stepped through the doorway, first noticing the large portal to the outside with light pouring down over green tendrils reaching here and there slowly claiming the space for themselves.

In a small alcove to his right below a bar hooked with clothing mostly fallen on the floor and partially devoured by time, there was the glitch. It curled like a C on the ground next to two smaller copies of itself.

There’s more of you?

The little creatures hair was far less matted and covered in debris than the glitches but it was clear to him they were of the same sort but far less threatening. The eye’s of one had not opened yet. He crept closer, feeling out of place in this scenario, uncertain what the glitch might do with his presence. As he approached it did nothing, but kept it’s eyes on the small ones, watching them wiggle and nuzzle within it’s bare flesh.

Kneeling before, he could almost feel a warmth radiating from the 3, whether a temperature or something else he couldn’t say. But it felt so peaceful. It felt like a triangle of life emitting something clearly life-giving.

He touched the tiny body of one of the small versions and felt a tingle crawl through his skin. It felt so delicate below his hand.

A yellow glow of light turned the room into a block of gold and warmed it even further. He felt no desire to ever go anywhere else. In fact staring down at these beings, he wanted to nuzzle in the glitches bosom himself. Maybe there would be protection there. Maybe there would be something different.

Yellow light. Oh no. I’m late.

Never had the concept of being late been something to him. He he knew somehow that he needed to get back to his home pod. He had a schedule. He had to follow it. This thought felt threatening, he stood as he recognized that he had never considered why. What wants me back. This wasn’t the time to consider for he had no resources. A strong sturring wrenched his insides, beckoning him to find food. It’s time to go.

The glitch finally looked up at him. Their eyes said everything that could be said.

Outside the golden room, he glanced to his left at the room he had entered through and felt the fear re-emerge. Without hesitation he turned down the other direction of the hall. It opened to an even large space cut in half by a pillar lying on the floor like it fell asleep on the carpet. Tons of golden light streamed in through the gaping opening to the outside.

Maybe this’ll work. He placed his hand on the enormous fallen thing and in that moment noticed the floor strewn about by papers littered in words and images. Their surface a light brown. He didn’t have the time to read them but he felt them shout at him. He grabbed as many as he could and stuffed them down through his collar, the only place his suit would hold anything.

He scaled the side of the rough pillar, taller than himself and stood on it’s corpse. YES. Down the length of it was his obvious escape Even the green chaos lie below the pillars body and had not arisen to consume it yet. His steps were quick though wobbly because of the sloping surface.

Despite weaving in and out of his previous route, the dramatic terrain had left such an imprint in his subconscious that he found the return not much of a challenge.

Entering his pod, he finally started to catch his breath. Looking around, the space had changed, although everything seemed exactly as he had left it. It felt like an eery silence had taken up residence without asking first.

The artificial light was now almost unbearable. It felt representative of something threatening. Regardless, he devoured the only thing he knew to be food and layed his head in bed that night still kneeling next to the creatures he had met in the world he had discovered. Everything had changed. And everything was going to change.

I’ll be there tomorrow. I have to see more. The thoughts slowly dissolved into dreams.

# Part 5

At one point in history, almost every engineer in the world decided that sheet metal was the greatest invention since sheets of bread. Rapidly everything was distilled into shapes that could be manufactured using this efficient new technology. Unfortunately, some engineer neglected to consider the fact that sheet metal creates an incredible inhospitable living space.

He woke up with his right hand touching the ice cold surface next to his bed. No sound told him when, no vibration shook him, just a feeling. Purely rhythm. “Instinct" some might call it, that sounds better than lines of code.

Wasting no time, he planted his feet on the ice cold floor.

He grabbed his uniform, prepared by the clothing module. 
He splashed his face at the washing module. 
Ate the porridge.
Took the rations.
Scanned his hand.
Climbed the steps.
And sat down.

He leaned to look down beside his seat, and looked down at the lever. There was markings, a strange red substance had dried on the surface. He didn’t linger on it, but wiped it off with the edge of his sleeve and pulled.

Fingers moved across the display in a sequence like deep ruts in a road driven over countless times. The smoke wiped away from the glass, revealing it.

Huh...

He sat and observed the orange shapes around him with an ice cold expression nearing indifference. A foreign terrain.

Moved again...That was quicker than last time. It gave him no particular feeling, no question came to mind, no exploration into the reason for his new home. He purely noticed the change.

It was just another day.

He put it in forward and was on his way. The new rough terrain was enjoyable, ungroomed from months of rolling over the same paths. The enormous machine bounced him back and forth over protruding masses, slopey terrain and ruts. It wasn't quite play, but he was content as Sysiphus on dementia.

This was a much shorter ride since replacement always set him right next to a fresh patch of pillars, untouched by death and destruction. Or “harvesting” as some might call it.

Over the course of the day,  pillars bowed to him one after the other, unable to escape his omnipotence. He noticed a fulfillment in their submission, like the power one feels when the allotted tasks for the day fall like lowly dominoes. But who needs little dominoes when the flick of a switch brings a 60 foot tall monolith crashing to the earth. Power is enjoyable. It wasn’t his to question the nature of his power, that was not his role, he was only to wield it as ordained. Everything works best if you do what your told.

The nature of a master is beyond a slaves question.

For 5 days this happened. 5 cycles. 5 repetitions. 5 warmups and cool-downs. 5 fresh jumpsuits.

Reaching to grab the handle before his head he lowered himself into the harvester, noticing a tightness by his bicep. The annoying irregularity felt like a rock embedded in his suit.

Recalling the protocol imprinted on the door of the clothing module stating, "Return garments to module immediately if disfigured," he climbed out of the cockpit, down the stairs and took it off. Placing it back on the rail, he felt the piece once more. He rubbed his thumb over it like it contained a genie. Something about the feeling of it made him feel disfigured.  Like he's shape-shifting but he's not the one holding the controls.

He couldn't help himself. He grabbed it off the rail and looked around for something sharp that could tear the fabric. Nothing immediately stood out to him but the water module in the corner. He stared at it for a few moments, outlining it's shape, then moved over toward it. He touched around the surface of it, feeling the sides of the metal counter bend downward and ran his fingers across the edge. Once they met the corner, he felt a sharpness to its point.

Naked, he knelt down and pressed the arm of his suit up against the bottom corner of the counter. He gripped hard and ran it back and forth vigorously, until he could hear the tightly knit fibers give-in.  He pulled at the slit, tearing at something within himself and reached inside. It rendered him a small smooth white brick, black indented dots across its surface.

And on the fifth day, God created every living creature that moves...according to their kinds.

He dropped the fifth suit to the ground and sat back on the cold floor perplexed. He held it so close to his face that it almost absorbed into his brain. Speaking of, it captured all of his attention for some reason he couldn't decipher. Like it was a key. But within himself he felt the desire to look away and also to look deeper. Like two magnets sat opposite his metal body.

What is this?

The tiny piece revealed none of its secrets to him. One, two, three. One, two, three. His thumb moved back and forth over the black indents on it's surface. In the recesses of his mind, he could feel the weight of three beings like they stood behind him, or lie below him, but in this moment, he had nothing to connect them to, he pressed into them but there was no link. Their memory had been extracted.

In the blink of an eye he found himself floating high above the ground in his harvester, nearing his most recent clearing. Though the orange terrain wasn't always decipherable at a distance, it looked as though the road he had begun to mold continued off on its own accord. He lost it past a curtain of thick pillars. That was enough for him.

His arms never pulled back on the wheel.  The clearing rolled past him. Without so much as a thought, he continued on like involuntary compulsion. Whether he even recognized it or not was unclear.

Something about the distance. The weaving road continuing to somewhere afar. It spoke to his soul with an alluring tongue. It was as if there was hidden treasure beckoning him, and his heart was a homing beacon.

The unridden road tipped downward and hugged the edge of a steep ridge. From it's peak and high up in the cockpit, he could see over the tall pillars that dove below into the depths. Never had he seen so far off into nothing, the dramatic terrain littered with pillars, appeared to flatten until it disappeared into infinite. No shapes were clear at that distance, but he did notice something strange.

He paused, the air above the flatness was an ominous swirl of colors. It was only slight, undetectable to most but a seasoned eye like his. He lingered on it like it might burst forth at him like a monster in waiting but it felt frozen as he let his eyes scour it's waves.

He felt little holding him back now. The subconscious decision to break free of his rhythm unlocked something inside.  It also seemed to unlock this strange terrain he was so used to ignoring.

The unkept trail winded before him, now declining against the side of some vertical face to his right. It tilted heavily in the opposite direction at times so far that he could see the tracks to his left instead of through the glass floor.

The pillars were thick in almost every direction, virtually untouched.

I wonder how far I can get.

Only moments later, the display in front of him strobed bright yellow, accompanied by a small whining noise inside his control space. OUT OF RANGE. PLEASE RETURN. OUT OF RANGE. PLEASE RETURN. The words scrolled endlessly across the screen until he grabbed his ration bag, poured out it's contents and slipped it over the nuisance. Silenced.

He sped up, and weaved through the pillars and corridors of dramatic terrain, obliterating small obtrusions and occasionally cutting a pillar or two when no other route was available. His eyes bounced around every corner of the cockpit like someone through a rubber ball. An over-the-shoulder observer may have asked the question, "What are you looking for?" And have been ignored altogether.

He failed to notice the atmosphere above him, dimming quite quickly, but continued on in mindless single-mindedness.

The pillars started to grow. They loomed above him like frozen parents. The density became too much for his pace, forcing him to saw continuously, like wading through a thick substance until he met his match.

There before him were the three largest pillars he had ever seen. He leaned forward to see where it ended but it seemed to continue forever into the ether. The rightmost, had fallen but now lie against the other two. Just by looking at the base of the pillars, he knew his grippers could not hold such monstrosities but he studied their nonetheless now that he didn't even have enough space to turn around.

Examining their shapes, the now limited light came back into his attention, deceiving him to worry time had passed even faster than it had. His body was as still as a rock while his mind perused the realm of possibilities.

Like a flash-flood of light, the king pillar before him lit up his entire view with a sharp sound that pierced the impenetrable walls of his machine. Every muscle clenched in his body. The air inside was always silent but somehow this broke through.

Like a flipped switch, the pillar took on a liquid whiteness crawling up the angular protrusions coming out of its main column. It was the most incredible site he had ever seen. Shifting shapes floated like bubbles from its body.

That can't be good. He was brought back to his senses by the abnormality of the experience and his heart started racing.

Pulling back on the wheel the massive mechanism, responded after a short delay and began moving.

Like it was mirroring his movement, the enormous pillar released its grip on the heavens and started to silently bow toward him.

OH SHIIIIIIT. He pulled harder on the wheel. OH SHIT. OH SHIT!

It crashed right in front of him and shot small shapes straight toward his view. It shook his machine and creating the second sound he had ever heard from within it, a dull roar bursting forth from the ground beneath him. His breath burst forth from his lungs in a similar fashion, while relief poured over him.

Only a few seconds later, the machine still moving backward, it ran up a short incline like he sat on top of some large mass. It high-centered the large mechanism leaving it stuck high up in the alien atmosphere. There was no direction his tracks could move him, every button simply vibrated the machine but didn't send it anywhere.

An idea occurred to him. He could feel the delicate balance he was perched on, and considered that maybe just maybe the movement of the enormous saw could send him here or there.

This isn't going to be easy. He thought to himself, considering the saw would need to be extended in the forward direction or the entire thing could tip to a side, causing it to rollover and be uncorrectable.

Thinking and preparing himself for the maneuver, he felt the hairs on his head start to lift. Before he could reach to investigate, another burst of light lasting only an instant illuminated the glass around him and even rippled through his body with a slight tingle.

Only seconds later, it repeated, even louder than the first. The display before him lit up red, and oscillated between intensity levels while a voice audibly repeated, "POWER ISSUE", "POWER ISSUE".

He had no idea what that meant, but looked down and noticed through the glass in the floor, a different view appeared. It was slowly returning to the orange shapes he was used to, but looked far more like his pod, or the inside of the cockpit or even his dreams. He leaned forward to look down and saw a being. A being that looked  like he felt he looked himself. With parts like him, but also quite different.

It hung like a rag doll out of a machine with what looked like the same interior as his. Though it's face was red with blood. It lied motionless below.

The orange closed in on the alien world and returned to distilled shapes with far less detail. Instantly, adrenaline coursed through him, he felt a connection to that being and was not about to let it disappear. I have to do something. He spun in each direction, eyes scanning the walls and surfaces surrounding him. Nothing appeared to give him any clue, until he looked down to his left. There, a small lever had the words, "...this lever can be twisted to open the hatch...".

# Part 6

The glass clicked as it tilted upward. A hostile wind hit him in the face.

The world around him was far different than the glass had shown him, strangely familiar. Though his adrenaline called him not to admire it but to move.

The delicate balance seemed more affected by the wind than his own weight moving around the machine. He was able to make his way down climbing the tread of one of the tracks like a ladder laying against a wall. The ceaseless wind was trying here and there to distract or deter him but he continued on.

From the outside the machine below looked nearly identical to his but had a different scattering of numbers along it's side.

He landed on its track and could see the arm of the being hanging up above him. If the wind were to tilt his machine largely to one side such that it slid in that direction, the arm might be crushed.

He climbed up the track to get to the point where he could climb up to the being. Tiny sharp crystals cracked under almost every one of his steps as he moved. The crash had misshapen the bottom machine to the point where the cockpit was now bowing downward at a steep angle.

He was able to find footing as he tried to climb the indents on the side and emerged over the opposite side of the being into it's cockpit.

Hello. He shouted over the growingly fierce wind and whining of the perched heavy object above them. HELLO. Can you move! His shouts made no difference, the only movement came from the wind whipping its long dark hair back and forth.

He lifted himself up using the precipice of the cockpit where the glass once met the body and flopped across the edge like a used towel, growling in pain. A gash across his hand sparkled with tiny crystals like a rare red jewel. He pulled it the pieces, whincing.

He now sat only a foot away from the being on the edge of its seat.

It's shape was like his but different, though it's suit disguised it, he could tell from it's size and the the size of it's hand that it was smaller than him. And nothing was frightening about it.

He leaned over and slowly pressed the floating tendrils of hair away from it's face. What they revealed to him, astounded him to his core. Something awakened deep inside himself. This being was beyond belief incredible.

Reaching across it, he softly touched it's head, wet somehow. He turned it toward himself. It's eyes remained closed but the opposite side of it's head revealed a ghastly mixture of blood and hair streaming down onto it's suit and the place on the machine where it had rested. He drew back within himself knowing inherently, the severity of what had happened.

The position they were in was growing very hostile, and the wind was slapping them back and forth. Without hesitation, he shifted to the edge and looked below. I think I can get it down.

For a few moments, he crouched in front of the alien. Examining it's shapes to determine how he might move and lower it down without hurting it moreso. His focus was intermittently interrupted by the shear sight of it. It took all of him not to simply freeze and admire it.

Snapping free of it's aura. He had a plan in mind.

He grabbed one of its arms and turned it so it faced the edge of the cockpit and then lied it down across the seat. He examined the edge of the cockpit, the same kind of spot where his hand had been gashed, littered with more tiny knives. He kicked these off with his boot one by one and then felt it for any remaining pain points. It was clear.

He then lifted the alien up and sat it on the edge with it's legs dangling freely in the rough wind.

He stood behind it, crouching slightly below the enormous piece of machinery looming above them. He then took it's arms and held them above it's head and pressed it forward with his knees.

It slid off the edge with minimal effort forcing him to grasp as tightly as he possibly could to keep it from falling down. The adrenaline was now fully coursing, giving him the additional strength his week muscles were in such need of. Leaning at the waste, he was able to loewr it almost to where it's legs touched the track below, but it wasn't enough. Still grasping as tightly as he could, he crouched slowly, until his midfront was pressing on the edge. It's body was now halfway collapsed on the track, but he was afraid it's head might hit hard. He let go with one hand to get more distance and then was able to finish setting it as softly as he could.

Utterly broken he hung over the edge, looking down at it's helpless form below. He felt as though his body wouldn't move anymore, and he closed his eyes. The shifting grayness above him roared. The crackling sound bounced off the dramatic terrain like a glass room. It brought to his attention the ounce of energy remaining within.

He lowered himself over and down the edge and landed next to the alien.

Getting below it and starting on a knee, he was able to lift it up with a great struggle and a gutteral sound.

These tracks were smaller than the ones on his machine and he was able to jump off them onto a nearby rock outcropping. The pillars surrounding, didn't feel like enough cover from the angry force above them, so he took the being below the two machines, between the tracks of the lower one.

After getting fully underneath, he collapsed next to it with little left inside him.

Now that he had touched the alien, he just wanted to hold it, not only for it's protection but for something else. Something he needed so desperately but had been starved of for so long. He wanted to scream but did not have the energy left.

At once, water came flowing down below the machine at the same time it came from his eyes. He gripped the alien tightly, pushing aside its hair and held its head close to his. Slowly moving closer until it's forhead touched his. His eyes recessed, and he pressed his brow low, the tears and water poured out.

The hair on the alien started lifting and again the light burst happened, louder than anything he had ever heard before, striking the mountain of machinery they lied beaneath. He held it close, not knowing what would happen.

For hours this continued.

He was able to fall asleep a few times but woke at the sound of every strike. And when his eyes cracked open, every time he saw a shape in the darkness at one of the openings. It stood, four legged, disappearing into the darkness as the light flashes dissipated, but eyes piercing through. Watching, and watching, and watching him. In these moments, his mind existed in the thin space between dream and reality, and dream kept dragging him back into it's clutches.

A particularly violent light strike woke him while the air was rushing back and forth vigorously. It commenced a loud roar above. The sound of machine upon machine. Slowly gaining speed as the top moved forward. It crashed forth at the front side, resting the front of it's massive heavy tracks on the ground with powerful thud.

The alien was still motionless.

Instead of fear, he recognized the opportunity. Now his machine was free to move around, but the atmosphere was still very tumultuous. He rested his head back down, with atleast now a plan.

# Part 7

His clothing made a strange sound as his movement peeled it from the sticky ground. More light now entered the area through the middle of the tracks and the air had returned to the stillness he first experienced.

The alien, still lifeless, had missed the entire commotion. Though probably for the better. He thought.

He crawled to the opening to have a look at the surroundings. The pillars, now very different things than what he was used to seeing, lied about in chaotic positions, here and there. Even large rocks seemed to have been thrown about by the previous nights tempest.

He stood and walked around, the sky still grayish but now cracking and shooting lazers of light upon various spots on the hillsides. The terrain arose on either sides of him like a curled piece of paper. They were coated in what looked like thick green clouds emerging from their stems. Together they created an impenetrable wall of color, only breaking for large patches of red ground and rocky outcroppings like shelves placed high up on the wall.

The sight was all consuming but familiar to him in the way it was when he first emerged from the cockpit of his machine. Almost a feeling like he had seen it before.

His machine still lied upon the smaller one below, but atleast it was touching down to the surface where he believed he may be able to drive it off.

Let's give it a try! He said to himself. As if anything made much sense in this moment. He figured why not return to something that felt sort of familiar.

Climbing the mass of bent metal, he made it to his cockpit. The nose of the cockpit was now almost completely filled with water up to the point where the opening in the glass was. He slid his lower half down into the water and stood on the wheel as he strapped himself into the seat. Hanging in that awkward position for a moment, he almost felt weightless. Then he shifted the lever to his lower left and the glass slid to close the opening.

He spun up the machine. And with no small amount of force was able to move the tracks, pulling at the soft ground over and over until the drew it forward and quickly dropped the back half. The water rushed over him but quickly disappeared through some hidden holes down in the floor. He was now level.

After repositioning it closer to the alien, he lowered the cockpit to it's true resting height and stepped off onto the track. We're going to get food, he said as he lept down to the alien and started lifting it into his arms. He managed to get it into his machine beside him by leaping from the smaller tracks of it's machine to his with it in his arms, and then started driving.

It's body was difficult to manage as the machine bounced and jeered in different directions, scaling rough terrain, but he kept the alien lying across his lap.

The route was clear to him because of his determination when he had trailblazed it. He didn't spend time weaving, but essentially had forged a path as straight as possible and the barriers he had to break through, were still visible even after the storm had ravaged the terrain.

It's head, resting on the side of the cockpit, turned toward him with a different sort of motion. It caught his eye and he stopped the machine. He placed his hands on either sides of its head and lifted carefully. It's eyes cracked open slowly and mouth barely shifted shapes but nothing came out.

Hello! He said longingly. HELLO...

It gave no response, and appeared to fall back asleep. Again, it was a sign to him to take action and he pressed forward at a greater pace.
